acariasis,Chronic blepharitis is a common cause of eye irritation and dryness. They are often treated without regard to causal factors such as parasites which are rarely mentioned....
acute bronchitis,"Cough is the most common illness-related reason for ambulatory care visits in the United States. Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis characterized by cough due to acute inflammation of the trachea and large airways without evidence of pneumonia. Pneumonia should be suspected in patients with tachypnea, tachycardia, dyspnea, or lung findings suggestive of pneumonia, and radiography is warranted. Pertussis should be suspected in patients with cough persisting for more than two weeks that is accompanied by symptoms such as paroxysmal cough, whooping cough, and post-tussive emesis, or recent pertussis exposure. The cough associated with acute bronchitis typically lasts about two to three weeks, and this should be emphasized with patients. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, and antibiotics are not indicated in patients without chronic lung disease. Antibiotics have been shown to provide only minimal benefit, reducing the cough or illness by about half a day, and have adverse effects, including allergic reactions, nausea and vomiting, and Clostridium difficile infection. Evaluation and treatment of bronchitis include ruling out secondary causes for cough, such as pneumonia; educating patients about the natural course of the disease; and recommending symptomatic treatment and avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic use. Strategies to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use include delayed prescriptions, patient education, and calling the infection a chest cold...."
acute bronchospasm,Tiotropium is a synthetic anticholinergic agent that is used as an inhalant for treatment of acute bronchospasm due to chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Tiotropium has not been implicated in causing liver enzyme elevations or clinically apparent acute liver injury....
acute cerebellar ataxia,"Cerebellar ataxia is a common finding in neurological practice and has a wide variety of causes, ranging from the chronic and slowly-progressive cerebellar degenerations to the acute cerebellar lesions due to infarction, edema and hemorrhage, configuring a true neurological emergency. Acute cerebellar ataxia is a syndrome that occurs in less than 72 hours, in previously healthy subjects. Acute ataxia usually results in hospitalization and extensive laboratory investigation. Clinicians are often faced with decisions on the extent and timing of the initial screening tests, particularly to detect treatable causes. The main group of diseases that may cause acute ataxias discussed in this article are: stroke, infectious, toxic, immune-mediated, paraneoplastic, vitamin deficiency, structural lesions and metabolic diseases. This review focuses on the etiologic and diagnostic considerations for acute ataxia...."
acute kidney failure,"Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes...."
acute sinusitis,"Acute and chronic sinusitis are common primary care presentations. They are caused by mucosal inflammation, which inhibits mucociliary function of the nose and paranasal sinuses...."
addison disease,"Addison's disease - the traditional term for primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) - is defined as the clinical manifestation of chronic glucocorticoid- and/or mineralocorticoid deficiency due to failure of the adrenal cortex which may result in an adrenal crisis with potentially life-threatening consequences. Even though efficient and safe pharmaceutical preparations for the substitution of endogenous gluco- and mineralocorticoids are established in therapy, the mortality in patients with PAI is still increased and the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is often reduced.PAI is a rare disease but recent data report an increasing prevalence. In addition to the common ""classical"" causes of PAI like autoimmune, infectious, neoplastic and genetic disorders, other iatrogenic conditions - mostly pharmacological side effects (e. g., adrenal haemorrhage associated with anticoagulants, drugs affecting glucocorticoid synthesis, action or metabolism and some of the novel anti-cancer checkpoint inhibitors) are contributing factors to this phenomenon.Due to the rarity of the disease and often non-specific symptoms at least in the early stages, PAI is frequently not considered resulting in a delayed diagnosis. Successful therapy is mainly based on adequate patient education as a cornerstone in the prevention and management of adrenal crisis. A focus of current research is in the development of pharmacokinetically optimized glucocorticoid preparations as well as regenerative therapies...."
alcohol intoxication,"Acute alcohol intoxication (AAI) is a harmful clinical condition, potentially life-threatening, secondary to the intake of large amounts of alcohol. Clinical manifestations of AAI are characterized by behavioural and neurological symptoms, even if its effects involve several organs and apparatus. Moreover, severe alcohol intoxication can produce a global neurological impairment leading to autonomic dysfunction, respiratory depression, coma and cardiac arrest. The evaluation of blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) is useful to confirm the suspicion of intoxication, both for clinical and legal reasons. Most of patients with AAI are referred to Emergency Departments due to behavioural, social, traumatic or clinical complications. Patient's stabilization is the first step in the management of AAI, in order to support vital functions and to prevent complications. Metadoxine represents a useful drug to increase ethanol metabolism and elimination. Given that AAI could represent a sentinel event of chronic alcohol abuse, patients presenting with acute intoxication should be screened for the presence of an underlying alcohol use disorder and referred to and an alcohol addiction unit to start a multidisciplinary treatment to achieve long term alcohol abstinence. The present review will focus on clinical features, diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies of AAI...."
alcoholic liver disease,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and data on the prevalence and profile of patients with early disease are limited. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. Prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. AH presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice, and in severe cases may transition to acute on chronic liver failure when the risk for mortality, depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures, may be as high as 20-50% at 1 month. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH and long-term mortality is related to severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures in patients hospitalized with ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation, a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis, may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD...."
allergic reactions,"Allergic reactions and anaphylaxis occur on a severity continuum from mild and self-limited to potentially life-threatening or fatal reactions. Anaphylaxis is typically a multiorgan phenomenon involving a broad range of effector cells and mediators. Emergency department visits for anaphylaxis are increasing, especially among children. There is a broad differential diagnosis for anaphylaxis, and the diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be aided by the use of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network clinical diagnostic criteria. Risk factors for severe anaphylaxis include older age, delayed epinephrine administration, and cardiopulmonary comorbidities...."
alopecia,"Alopecia areata (AA) is a common chronic tissue-specific autoimmune disease, resulting in hair loss, that affects up to 2% of the general population. The exact pathobiology of AA has still remained elusive, while the common theory is the collapse of the immune privilege of the hair follicle caused by immunological mechanism. Multiple genetic and environment factors contribute to the pathogenesis of AA. There are several clinical treatments for AA, varying from one or multiple well-defined patches to more diffuse or total hair loss of the scalp (alopecia totalis) or hair loss of the entire body (alopecia universalis). The available treatments for AA, such as corticosteroids and other immunomodulators, minoxidil, and contact immunotherapy, are of limited efficacy with a high risk of adverse effects and high recurrence rates, especially for patients with severe AA. Recent insights into the pathogenesis of AA have led to the development of new treatment strategies, such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, biologics, and several small molecular agents. In addition, modern therapies for AA, including antihistamines, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection, and other novel therapies have been well explored. In this review, we discussed the recent advances in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of AA...."
anal fissure,"Anal fissure is one of the most common anorectal diseases resulting from a longitudinal tear in anoderm under the dentate line. It causes painful defecation and bleeding per anum. Most of the fissures heal by conservative means but a significant proportion turns chronic, leading to a negative impact upon the overall quality of life of a patient. The treatment options for chronic fissures are generally based on reducing the anal pressures and include non-surgical and surgical modalities. Lateral internal sphincterotomy still remains the gold standard for definitive management of anal fissure though anal incontinence is a serious complication of the procedure. In recent years, various modifications have evolved to minimize chances of incontinence besides the evolution of a wide range of non-surgical options of management. This review outlines the key points in the clinical presentation, etiopathogenesis, impact on the quality of life and management of anal fissure in the light of the recent updates in literature...."
analgesic nephropathy,"The clinical manifestations of drug-induced renal disease may include all the manifestations attributed to natural or spontaneous renal diseases such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, acute nephritic syndrome, renal colic, haematuria, selective tubular defects, obstructive nephropathy, etc. It is therefore vital in any patient with renal disease whatever the clinical manifestations might be, to obtain a meticulous drug and toxin inventory. Withdrawal of the offending drug may result in amelioration or cure of the renal disorder although in the case of severe renal failure it may be necessary to utilise haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis to tide the patient over the period of acute renal failure. Analgesic nephropathy is an important cause of terminal chronic renal failure and it is therefore vital to make the diagnosis as early as possible. The pathogenesis of some drug-induced renal disorders appears to be immunologically mediated. There are many other pathogenetic mechanisms involved in drug-induced renal disorders and some drugs may under appropriate circumstances be responsible for a variety of different nephrotoxic effects. For example, the sulphonamides have been incriminated in examples of crystalluria, acute interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, generalised hypersensitivity reactions, polyarteritis nodosa and drug-induced lupus erythematosus...."
anemia,"The World Health Organization estimates that approximately a quarter of the world's population suffers from anemia, including almost half of preschool-age children. Globally, iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia. Other important causes of anemia in children are hemoglobinopathies, infection, and other chronic diseases. Anemia is associated with increased morbidity, including neurologic complications, increased risk of low birth weight, infection, and heart failure, as well as increased mortality. When approaching a child with anemia, detailed historical information, particularly diet, environmental exposures, and family history, often yield important clues to the diagnosis. Dysmorphic features on physical examination may indicate syndromic causes of anemia. Diagnostic testing involves a stepwise approach utilizing various laboratory techniques. The increasing availability of genetic testing is providing new mechanistic insights into inherited anemias and allowing diagnosis in many previously undiagnosed cases. Population-based approaches are being taken to address nutritional anemias. Novel pharmacologic agents and advances in gene therapy-based therapeutics have the potential to ameliorate anemia-associated disease and provide treatment strategies even in the most difficult and complex cases...."
anemia due to chronic kidney disease,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children has a significant impact on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The degree of renal dysfunction should be calculated using pediatric-specific formulas and the degree of CKD staged; this allows for appropriate dosing of medications based on renal function and monitoring for progression and comorbid conditions including metabolic acidosis, bone disease, anemia, cardiovascular complications, malnutrition and electrolyte abnormalities, growth failure, and psychosocial issues. Treatment strategies include treating the underlying disease and using general renal protective measures. Effective management of these complex issues requires a specialized multidisciplinary team approach...."
anemia of chronic disease,"Anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) is generated by the activation of the immune system by autoantigens, microbial molecules or tumour antigens resulting in the release of cytokines that cause an elevation of serum hepcidin, hypoferraemia, suppression of erythropoiesis, decrease in erythropoietin (EPO) and shortening of the half-life of red blood cells. Anaemia is usually normocytic and normochromic, which is the most prevalent after iron deficiency anaemia, and it is the most frequent in the elderly and in hospitalized patients. If the anaemia is severe, the patient's quality of life deteriorates, and it can have a negative impact on survival. Treatment is aimed at controlling the underlying disease and correcting anaemia. Sometimes intravenous iron and EPO have been used, but the therapeutic future is directed against hepcidin, which is the final target of anaemia...."
ankylosing spondylitis,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) affects one in 200 individuals and is usually diagnosed many years after onset of symptoms. Chronic back pain is common and recognition of early disease requires clinical experience and a high index of suspicion. Further, inflammatory markers are not invariably elevated and radiographic changes are often late findings...."
aortic regurgitation,"Aortic regurgitation (AR) has an estimated prevalence of 4.9% in the Framingham study, with moderate or severe AR occurring in 0.5% of the study population. The incidence and severity of AR increases with age, and may occur acutely or as a chronic valvular disease with distinct presentations, natural history and management strategy. Our review is a comprehensive description of the varied presentation of aortic regurgitation and its management...."
arterial embolism,"Endovascular intervention is a safe, effective treatment modality in the management of diverse pulmonary vascular pathologies, including acute or chronic thromboembolic disease, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (pAVMs), pulmonary artery or bronchial artery hemorrhage, and foreign body retrieval. This article reviews indications, contraindications, techniques, and outcomes in endovascular management of common pulmonary vascular pathologies, with the goal of improving operator familiarity and facility with these procedures...."
aspiration pneumonia,"The growing population of older people worldwide represents a great challenge for health systems. The elderly are at increased risk of infectious diseases such as pneumonia, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality related mainly to age-related physiological changes in the immune system (immunosenescence), the presence of multiple chronic comorbidities, and frailty. In pneumonia, microaspiration is recognized as the main pathogenic mechanism; while macroaspiration which refers to the aspiration of a large amount of oropharyngeal or upper gastrointestinal content passing through the vocal cords and trachea into the lungs is identified as ""aspiration pneumonia"". Although there are strategies for the prevention and management of patients with pneumonia that have been shown to be effective in older people with pneumonia, more research is needed on aspiration pneumonia, its risk factors and outcomes, especially since there are no specific criteria for its diagnosis and consequently, the studies on aspiration pneumonia include heterogeneous populations...."
asthma,Asthma is a common condition due to chronic inflammation of the lower respiratory tract. Chronic lower airway inflammation is known to be more common in individuals that also have inflammatory disorders of the upper airway. The scientific understanding of asthma continues to improve and it is important for providers who treat upper or lower airway inflammation to be familiar with asthma's definition and pathophysiology....
atonic bladder,"Neurogenic bladder dysfunction in children is frequently seen in patients with meningomyelocele (MMC). The disorder carries a high risk for all kinds of complications, with renal damage being the most important. More than 95% of MMC patients have a neurogenic bladder, the paramount manifestation of which is a disturbed coordination between detrusor and sphincter muscles. This vesicourethral dysfunction leads to defective filling and emptying of the urinary bladder. Voiding at will is almost never possible. According to the location and extent of the neural tube lesion, patients have either an atonic or a hypertonic pelvic floor and either an atonic or a hypertonic detrusor, leading to four classic combinations. Hypertonic sphincter and detrusor hyperactivity lead to the most dangerous form of neurogenic bladder, referred to as the ""unsafe"" bladder. The presence of residual urine in a high-pressure container causes either decompensation of the detrusor with vesicoureteral reflux or deterioration of the bladder wall with hypertrophy and stiffness resulting in uterovesical obstruction. The subsequent insufficient drainage of the upper urinary tract leads to decompensation of the ureters and finally to chronic renal disease, the process being accelerated by urinary tract infections. The aim of treatment is to restore as much as possible both essential functions: urine storage and timely emptying of the reservoir. What should and can be achieved is a more or less adequate, low-pressure, functional capacity of the bladder that is emptied as completely as possible by clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). MMC leads to the prototype of neurogenic bladder in childhood. What we know and what we do for MMC patients can roughly be applied to all other forms of neurogenic bladder, either congenital or acquired...."
atopic dermatitis,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, non-infectious inflammatory dermatosis. Acharacteristic feature is persistent itching of the skin. The chronic, relapsing course of the disease, economic burden, and the whole family's involvement in the treatment process immensely reduce the quality of life of patients and their families. The disease emerges as a social problem by increasing indirect costs, such as visiting a doctor, absenteeism from work and school, and avoiding social interactions. Thepathophysiology of atopic dermatitis is complex and multifactorial. It includes genetic disorders, a defect in the epidermal barrier, an altered immune response, anddisruption of the skin's microbial balance. The numerous complex changes at thegenetic level and innate and adaptive immunity provide the basis for characterizing the various phenotypes and endotypes of atopic dermatitis. Emerging therapies rely on the action of specific molecules involved in the disease's pathogenesis. It may be the starting point for the individualization of atopic dermatitis treatment. This paper will try to present some molecular mechanisms of atopic dermatitis and their clinical implications...."
atrial flutter,"Atrial flutter is a specific electrical entity. It has a now well-established mechanism involving a single macro-re-entrant circuit. Whilst many patients with atrial flutter may develop atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter deserves its own recognition and requires specific management. Acute termination by drugs is possible, although adding pacing improves efficacy. Ibutilide is a new intravenous therapy with considerable efficacy by with a risk of torsade de pointes. For long-term control, radiofrequency ablation is gradually supplanting chronic oral antiarrhythmic strategies...."
atrophic vaginitis,"Introduced in 2014, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) describes a variety of unpleasant genital, sexual and urinary symptoms that can either be isolated or coexisting and are not related to other medical conditions. GSM is a chronic and progressive condition that requires early recognition and appropriate management to preserve urogenital health. Despite the importance of early detection and treatment, the condition is consistently underdiagnosed and undertreated. Herein, we emphasize how to diagnose GSM in postmenopausal, hypoestrogenic, and hypoandrogenic women and summarize evidence-based treatments focusing on prescription treatments and adjunctive therapies...."
autonomic neuropathy,"Autonomic neuropathies represent a complex group of disorders that preferentially target autonomic fibers and can be classified as either acute/subacute or chronic in onset. Acute-onset autonomic neuropathies manifest with such conditions as paraneoplastic syndromes, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Sjögren syndrome, infection, or toxins/chemotherapy. When the presentation is acute, immune-mediated, and without a secondary cause, autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is likely, and should be considered for immunotherapy. Of the chronic-onset forms, diabetes is the most widespread and disabling, with autonomic impairment portending increased mortality and cardiac wall remodeling risk. Acquired light chain (AL) and transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis represent two other key etiologies, with TTR amyloidosis now amenable to newly-approved gene-modifying therapies. The COMPASS-31 questionnaire is a validated outcome measure that can be used to monitor autonomic severity and track treatment response. Symptomatic treatments targeting orthostatic hypotension, among other symptoms, should be individualized and complement disease-modifying therapy, when possible...."
benign vaginal discharge (leukorrhea),"Uterine fibroids (UFs), leiomyomas or myomas, are a type of malignancy that affects the smooth muscle of the uterus, and it is most commonly detected in women of reproductive age. Uterine fibroids are benign monoclonal growths that emerge from uterine smooth muscle cells (myometrium) as well as fibroblasts. Uterine fibroid symptoms include abnormal menstrual bleeding leading to anaemia, tiredness, chronic vaginal discharge, and pain during periods. Other symptoms include protrusion of the abdomen, pain during intercourse, dysfunctions of bladder/bowel leading to urinary incontinence/retention, pain, and constipation. It is also associated with reproductive issues like impaired fertility, conceiving complications, and adverse obstetric outcomes. It is the leading cause of gynaecological hospitalisation in the American subcontinent and a common reason for the hysterectomy. Twenty-five percent of the reproductive women experience the symptoms of uterine fibroids, and among them, around 25% require hospitalization due to the severity of the disease. The frequency of the disease remains underestimated as many women stay asymptomatic and symptoms appear gradually; therefore, the condition remains undiagnosed. The exact frequency of uterine fibroids varies depending on the diagnosis, and the population investigated; nonetheless, the incidence of uterine fibroids in reproductive women ranges from 5.4 percent to 77 percent. The uterine fibroid treatment included painkillers, supplementation with iron, vitamin D3, birth control, hormone therapy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, drugs modulating the estrogen receptors, and surgical removal of the fibroids. However, more research needed at the level of gene to get a keen insight and treat the disease efficiently...."
bile duct obstruction,"The care of the patient with cholestasis hinges on identifying the etiology, treating reversible causes, and managing chronic cholestatic processes. PBC and PSC are important causes of chronic cholestasis, and are the most common causes of cholestatic liver disease. Effective therapy is available for patients with PBC, whereas none exists for patients with PSC. Awareness of the complications that may be associated with cholestasis and implementing the appropriate management are essential...."
blockage of upper airway,"Eosinophilic inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis, severity, and treatment responsiveness of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP)...."
bone disorder,"Osteoporosis is defined as a skeletal disorder of compromised bone strength predisposing those affected to an elevated risk of fracture. However, based on bone histology, osteoporosis is only part of a spectrum of skeletal complications that includes osteomalacia and the various forms of renal osteodystrophy of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). In addition, the label ""kidney-induced osteoporosis"" has been proposed, even though the changes caused by CKD do not qualify as osteoporosis by the histological diagnosis. It is clear, therefore, that such terminology may not be helpful diagnostically or in making treatment decisions. A new label, ""CKD-MBD/osteoporosis"" could be a more appropriate term because it brings osteoporosis under the official label of CKD-MBD. Neither laboratory nor noninvasive diagnostic investigations can discriminate osteoporosis from the several forms of renal osteodystrophy. Transiliac crest bone biopsy can make the diagnosis of osteoporosis by exclusion of other kidney-associated bone diseases, but its availability is limited. Recently, a classification of metabolic bone diseases based on bone turnover, from low to high, together with mineralization and bone volume, has been proposed. Therapeutically, no antifracture treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with kidney-associated bone disease. Agents that suppress parathyroid hormone (vitamin D analogues and calcimimetics) are used to treat hyperparathyroid bone disease. Antiresorptive and osteoanabolic agents approved for osteoporosis are being used off-label to treat CKD stages 3b-5 in high-risk patients. It has now been suggested that intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone as early as CKD stage 2 could be an effective management strategy. If confirmed in clinical trials, it could mitigate the retention of phosphorus and subsequently the rise in fibroblast growth factor 23 and may be beneficial for coexisting osteoporosis...."
brain abscess,These European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guidelines are intended for clinicians involved in diagnosis and treatment of brain abscess in children and adults....
bronchiectasis,"Bronchiectasis is a final common pathway of a wide variety of underlying conditions including infectious, autoimmune, allergic, genetic and inflammatory conditions. Patients experience a chronic disease with variable clinical symptoms and course, but most experience cough, sputum production and recurrent exacerbations. Symptoms of bronchiectasis lead to poor quality of life and exacerbations are the major driver of morbidity and mortality. Patients are often chronically infected with bacteria with the most common being Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. Treatment of bronchiectasis includes standardised testing to identify the underlying cause with targeted treatment if immune deficiency, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, for example, are identified. Airway clearance is the mainstay of therapy for patients with symptoms of cough and sputum production. Frequently exacerbating patients may benefit from long term antibiotic or mucoactive therapies. Bronchiectasis is a heterogeneous disease and increasingly precision medicine approaches are advocated to target treatments most appropriately and to limit the emergence of antimicrobial resistance...."
campylobacter infection,"Campylobacter jejuni infection is one of the most widespread infectious diseases of the last century. The incidence and prevalence of campylobacteriosis have increased in both developed and developing countries over the last 10 years. The dramatic increase in North America, Europe, and Australia is alarming, and data from parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East indicate that campylobacteriosis is endemic in these areas, especially in children. In addition to C. jejuni, there is increasing recognition of the clinical importance of emerging Campylobacter species, including Campylobacter concisus and Campylobacter ureolyticus. Poultry is a major reservoir and source of transmission of campylobacteriosis to humans. Other risk factors include consumption of animal products and water, contact with animals, and international travel. Strategic implementation of multifaceted biocontrol measures to reduce the transmission of this group of pathogens is paramount for public health. Overall, campylobacteriosis is still one of the most important infectious diseases that is likely to challenge global health in the years to come. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the global epidemiology, transmission, and clinical relevance of Campylobacter infection...."
central serous choroidopathy,"Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is the fourth most common non-surgical retinopathy associated with fluid leakage. The pathogenesis is not yet completely understood, but changes in the choroid, sclera and RPE have been described associated with venous congestion of choroidal outflow. CSC can be categorised into acute, chronic, and recurrent subtypes with recent classifications of simple and complex based on the area of RPE change seen on fundus autofluorescence. A multimodal imaging approach is helpful in the diagnosis and management of CSC and secondary complications such as type 1 neovascularisation. Although spontaneous resolution with relatively good visual outcomes is common, treatment should be considered in patients with persistent or recurrent SRF. Treatment options include laser, systemic medications, intravitreal therapy, and surgery. Of these, argon laser for focal extramacular fluid leaks and photodynamic therapy of leakage identified by indocyanine-green angiography currently have the greatest supportive evidence...."
cervical polyps,"Polyps of the lower reproductive tract are found in 7.8-50% of women. It has been hypothesized that cytogenetic modifications on chromosomes 6, 7 and 12 as well as epigenetic factors involving enzyme and metabolic activities may cause polyps to develop. Cervical polyps found in 2-5% of cases are of low clinical significance and can cause, although rarely, post coital bleedings. Cervical polyps grow during pregnancy and mucorrhoea. Trans vaginal ultrasound (TVU) provides an excellent diagnostic technique to diagnose the size and the anatomic location of endometrial polyps (EPs). In asymptomatic young woman with small EPs <10 mm in size, conservative management can be safely followed by monitoring the polyp growth. EPs located at the fundal and tubocornual regions mechanically affect fertility and disturb normal cellular function due to chronic inflammation. In cases where Eps are a cause of subfertility mechanical hysteroscopic resection is advisable. When the sole reason for infertility is an EP, the patient often becomes spontaneously pregnant shortly after removal. EP Detection in either peri- or post-menopausal age, in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients calls for meticulous hysteroscopic examination and polypectomy is mandatory. Endometrial curettage is also recommended to rule out sub clinical endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Hysteroscopic surgery for large EPs using bipolar resectoscopes, hysteroscopic morcellators or shavers are considered equally efficient and safe under general anaesthesia. Recurrence rate of EPs after resection is unknown. The recent advances in TVU and hysteroscopy, however, should provide an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of polyp in the female reproductive tract with minimal recurrence or surgery complications. The significantly increased incidence of colorectal polyps in cohorts that also had EPs might indicate that patients with EPs should be also referred for colonoscopy. EPs have the lowest incidence of malignant transformation as compared to colon, urinary bladder, oropharyngeal, nasal and laryngeal carcinomas...."
cervicitis,"Cervicitis is the inflammation of the cervix. It is usually caused by an infectious agent, usually sexually transmitted. Cervicitis is frequently asymptomatic and silent infection can cause complications of the upper genital tract. The symptoms are usually nonspecific, the most significant being an increase in vaginal discharge and/or intermenstrual bleeding. For its diagnosis, there are commercial systems based on molecular techniques that include almost all of the known pathogens associated with cervicitis, although cultures should not be abandoned due to the need to conduct studies of susceptibility to antibiotics. It is recommended to initiate an empirical antibiotic therapy that covers C.trachomatis and N.gonorrhoeae in the case of women at high risk of infection by these pathogens, especially if the follow-up is not assured or adequate diagnostic tests are not available. In women with low risk of sexually transmitted infection, antibiotic therapy should be adjusted to the results of the microbiological results...."
chronic constipation,"Introduction: Chronic constipation is highly prevalent, affecting between 10% and 15% of the population. The Rome IV criteria categorizes disorders of chronic constipation into four subtypes: (a) functional constipation, (b) irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, (c) opioid-induced constipation, and (d) functional defecation disorders, including inadequate defecatory propulsion and dyssynergic defecation. The initial management approach for these disorders is similar, focusing on diet, lifestyle and the use of standard over-the-counter laxatives. If unsuccessful, further therapy is tailored according to subtype.Areas covered: This review covers the definition, epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, investigations and management of the Rome IV disorders of chronic constipation.Expert opinion: By adopting a logical step-wise approach toward the diagnosis of chronic constipation and its individual subtypes, clinicians have the opportunity to tailor therapy accordingly and improve symptoms, quality of life, and patient satisfaction...."
chronic glaucoma,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The global prevalence of glaucoma in people aged 40 to 80 years is estimated to be 3.5%. With the growing number and proportion of older persons in the population, it is projected that 111.8 million people will have glaucoma in 2040. Currently available treatments cannot reverse glaucomatous damage to the visual system; however, early diagnosis and treatment can prevent progression of the disease. In most cases, glaucoma is a chronic condition that requires lifelong management. This article reviews the pathophysiology, classification, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of glaucoma...."
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy,"Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is immune-mediated neuropathy defined by clinical progression for more than 2 months, and electrodiagnostic evidence of peripheral nerve demyelination. However, there are several clinical phenotypes, classified into ""typical CIDP,"" and ""atypical CIDP"" such as ""multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM)."" Typical CIDP is a most common form, characterized by symmetric proximal and distal muscle weakness and motor-dominant manifestation. In typical CIDP, demyelination predominantly affects the distal nerve terminals and nerve roots, where the blood-nerve barrier is anatomically deficient. These features suggest antibody-mediated demyelination in typical CIDP. By contrast, MADSAM is characterized by multifocal demyelination in the nerve trunks, and such distribution of lesions results in multiple mononeuropathy or asymmetric polyneuropathy. In MADSAM, cellular immunity is likely to be involved in the breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier at the site of conduction block. Clinical features are probably determined by the distribution of demyelinative lesions and reflect the different immunopathogenesis of each CIDP subtype that would require different treatment strategy...."

chronic kidney disease,"Chronic kidney disease is highly prevalent (10-13% of the population), irreversible, progressive, and associated with higher cardiovascular risk. Patients with this pathology remain asymptomatic most of the time, presenting the complications typical of renal dysfunction only in more advanced stages. Its treatment can be conservative (patients without indication for dialysis, usually those with glomerular filtration rate above 15 ml/minute) or replacement therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation). The objectives of the conservative treatment for chronic kidney disease are to slow down the progression of kidney dysfunction, treat complications (anemia, bone diseases, cardiovascular diseases), vaccination for hepatitis B, and preparation for kidney replacement therapy...."
chronic knee pain,"Knee pain affects approximately 25% of adults, and its prevalence has increased almost 65% over the past 20 years, accounting for nearly 4 million primary care visits annually. Initial evaluation should emphasize excluding urgent causes while considering the need for referral. Key aspects of the patient history include age; location, onset, duration, and quality of pain; associated mechanical or systemic symptoms; history of swelling; description of precipitating trauma; and pertinent medical or surgical history. Patients requiring urgent referral generally have severe pain, swelling, and instability or inability to bear weight in association with acute trauma or have signs of joint infection such as fever, swelling, erythema, and limited range of motion. A systematic approach to examination of the knee includes inspection, palpation, evaluation of range of motion and strength, neurovascular testing, and special (provocative) tests. Radiographic imaging should be reserved for chronic knee pain (more than six weeks) or acute traumatic pain in patients who meet specific evidence-based criteria. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography allows for detailed evaluation of effusions, cysts (e.g., Baker cyst), and superficial structures. Magnetic resonance imaging is rarely used for patients with emergent cases and should generally be an option only when surgery is considered or when a patient experiences persistent pain despite adequate conservative treatment. When the initial history and physical examination suggest but do not confirm a specific diagnosis, laboratory tests can be used as a confirmatory or diagnostic tool...."
chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"The treatment landscape for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has changed considerably with the introduction of very effective oral targeted therapies (such as Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors and venetoclax) and next-generation anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (such as obinutuzumab). These agents lead to improved outcomes in patients with CLL, even among those with high-risk features, such as del17p13 or TP53 mutation and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) genes. Selecting the right treatment for the right patient requires consideration of disease characteristics and prior treatment sequence, as well as patient preferences and comorbidities. The CLL-International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI) remains the best-validated tool in predicting the time to first therapy among previously untreated patients, which guides selection for early intervention efforts. This review summarizes our current approach to the management of CLL, right from the time of diagnosis through relapsed disease...."

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and health-care use worldwide. COPD is caused by exposure to inhaled noxious particles, notably tobacco smoke and pollutants. However, the broad range of factors that increase the risk of development and progression of COPD throughout the life course are increasingly being recognised. Innovations in omics and imaging techniques have provided greater insight into disease pathobiology, which might result in advances in COPD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Although few novel treatments have been approved for COPD in the past 5 years, advances have been made in targeting existing therapies to specific subpopulations using new biomarker-based strategies. Additionally, COVID-19 has undeniably affected individuals with COPD, who are not only at higher risk for severe disease manifestations than healthy individuals but also negatively affected by interruptions in health-care delivery and social isolation. This Seminar reviews COPD with an emphasis on recent advances in epidemiology, pathophysiology, imaging, diagnosis, and treatment...."

chronic otitis media,"Chronic otitis media (COM) is a common problem facing general practitioners, pediatricians and otolaryngologists. This article reviews the aetiopathogenesis, epidemiology, presentation, natural history, complications and management of COM. The literature was reviewed by using the PubMed search engine and entering a combination of terms including ""COM"", ""diagnosis"", ""incidence"", ""complications"" and ""management"". Relevant articles were identified and examined for content. What is the ""take-home"" message for the clinician? COM is a common problem with various sub-categories according to the disease state. It most commonly presents with painless otorrhoea and hearing loss. Treatment options vary according to the activity and type of disease encountered. COM carries significant patient morbidity...."
chronic pain disorder,"Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is one of the common diseases in urology and gynecology. CPPS is a multifactorial disorder where pain may originate in any of the urogynecological, gastrointestinal, pelvic musculoskeletal, or nervous systems. The symptoms of CPPS appear to result from an interplay between psychological factors and dysfunction in the immune, neurological, and endocrine systems. The aim of this article was to present new insight about CPPS in order to raise awareness of nursing and medical staff in the identification and diagnosis of the syndrome and to promote an appropriate treatment for each woman who suffers from CPPS...."
chronic pancreatitis,"Chronic pancreatitis is a multifactorial, fibroinflammatory syndrome in which repetitive episodes of pancreatic inflammation lead to extensive fibrotic tissue replacement, resulting in chronic pain, exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, reduced quality of life, and a shorter life expectancy. The incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis is rising and no curative treatment is available. Using novel diagnostic algorithms, definitive chronic pancreatitis can be diagnosed by imaging criteria alone, whereas probable chronic pancreatitis requires clinical features and imaging criteria. Criteria for the diagnosis of early chronic pancreatitis are still under discussion and need prospective validation in clinical trials. Cross-sectional imaging should be used first; endoscopic ultrasound is needed only when CT or MRI are inconclusive or to plan therapeutic interventions. Management of chronic pancreatitis requires an interdisciplinary approach including primary care practitioners, gastroenterologists, surgeons, radiologists, pain specialists, and nutritional therapists. Patients with chronic pancreatitis should be seen at least once a year and re-evaluated for causal risk factors, symptom control, and complications such as malnutrition, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and diabetes; refer to a specialised centre if symptoms are poorly controlled or there is risk of deterioration. Scoring systems to monitor disease progression have been developed and validated internationally. Interventional treatments for pain or cholestasis should be done by specialists only, and early discussion of treatment approaches should include all medical disciplines involved in care. Throughout this Seminar, we address research needs such as staging of pancreatitis, aspects of malnutrition and pain, and cancer surveillance, to help improve the care of patients...."
chronic sinusitis,"Fungal sinusitis is characterized into invasive and noninvasive forms. The invasive variety is further classified into acute, chronic and granulomatous forms; and the noninvasive variety into fungus ball and allergic fungal sinusitis. Each of these different forms has a unique radiologic appearance. The clinicopathologic and corresponding radiologic spectrum and differences in treatment strategies of fungal sinusitis make it an important diagnosis for clinicians and radiologists to always consider. This is particularly true of invasive fungal sinusitis, which typically affects immuno compromised patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis allows initiation of appropriate treatment strategies resulting in favorable outcome...."
chronic subdural hematoma,"Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a complex disease with an overall incidence of 1.7-20.6 per 100,000 persons per year and is more commonly encountered in the elderly population. The pathophysiologic cycle of CSDH formation and expansion involves traumatic and inflammatory components that promote the formation of membranes with permeable neovessels. Many drugs targeting different elements of this cycle are being actively investigated as potential therapeutic agents in CSDH. Burr hole craniostomy appears to be the most commonly used procedure for surgical evacuation, and outcomes are generally favorable. Recurrence can occur in 10%-20% of patients and is associated with several clinical and radiographic predictors. Middle meningeal artery embolization represents one of the latest additions to the therapeutic arsenal of cerebrovascular specialists in treating CSDH and is being critically evaluated in numerous ongoing clinical trials...."
chronic ulcer,"The widespread existence of unhealed wounds, ulcers, and burns has a great impact on public health and economy. Many interventions, including new medications and technologies, are being used to help achieve significant wound healing and to eliminate infections. Therefore, to find an intervention that has both therapeutic effect on the healing process and the ability to kill microbes is of great value. Honey is a natural product that has been recently introduced in modern medical practice. Honey's antibacterial properties and its effects on wound healing have been thoroughly investigated. Laboratory studies and clinical trials have shown that honey is an effective broad-spectrum antibacterial agent. This paper reviews data that support the effectiveness of natural honey in wound healing and its ability to sterilize infected wounds. Studies on the therapeutic effects of honey collected in different geographical areas on skin wounds, skin and gastric ulcers, and burns are reviewed and mechanisms of action are discussed. (Ulcers and burns are included as an example of challenging wounds.) The data show that the wound healing properties of honey include stimulation of tissue growth, enhanced epithelialization, and minimized scar formation. These effects are ascribed to honey's acidity, hydrogen peroxide content, osmotic effect, nutritional and antioxidant contents, stimulation of immunity, and to unidentified compounds. Prostaglandins and nitric oxide play a major role in inflammation, microbial killing, and the healing process. Honey was found to lower prostaglandin levels and elevate nitric oxide end products. These properties might help to explain some biological and therapeutic properties of honey, particularly as an antibacterial agent or wound healer. The data presented here demonstrate that honeys from different geographical areas have considerable therapeutic effects on chronic wounds, ulcers, and burns. The results encourage the use of honey in clinical practice as a natural and safe wound healer...."
cold sore,"Herpes labialis remains exceedingly prevalent and is one of the most common human viral infections throughout the world. Recurrent herpes labialis evolves from the initial viral infection by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) which subsequently presents with or without symptoms. Reactivation of this virus is triggered by psychosocial factors such as stress, febrile environment, ultraviolet light susceptibility, or specific dietary inadequacy. This virus infection is also characterized by uninterrupted transitions between chronic-latent and acute-recurrent phases, allowing the virus to opportunistically avoid immunity and warrant the transmission to other vulnerable hosts simultaneously. This review comprehensively evaluates the current evidence on epidemiology, pathogenesis, transmission modes, clinical manifestations, and current management options of herpes labialis infections...."

congenital cytomegalovirus,"Congenital cytomegalovirus is the most frequent, yet under-recognised, infectious cause of newborn malformation in developed countries. Despite its clinical and public health importance, questions remain regarding the best diagnostic methods for identifying maternal and neonatal infection, and regarding optimal prevention and therapeutic strategies for infected mothers and neonates. The absence of guidelines impairs global efforts to decrease the effect of congenital cytomegalovirus. Data in the literature suggest that congenital cytomegalovirus infection remains a research priority, but data are yet to be translated into clinical practice. An informal International Congenital Cytomegalovirus Recommendations Group was convened in 2015 to address these questions and to provide recommendations for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. On the basis of consensus discussions and a review of the literature, we do not support universal screening of mothers and the routine use of cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin for prophylaxis or treatment of infected mothers. However, treatment guidelines for infected neonates were recommended. Consideration must be given to universal neonatal screening for cytomegalovirus to facilitate early detection and intervention for sensorineural hearing loss and developmental delay, where appropriate. The group agreed that education and prevention strategies for mothers were beneficial, and that recommendations will need continual updating as further data become available...."
conjunctivitis due to allergy,"Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a chronic, bilateral corneal and conjunctival problem which typically presents in young individuals. VKC is characterized by itching, photophobia, white mucous discharge, lacrimation, foreign body sensation, and pain due to corneal involvement of shield ulcers. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is categorized within ocular diseases. The diagnosis is clinical, as no sure biomarkers pathognomonic of the disease have yet been identified. The VKC therapy relies on different types of drugs, from antihistamines and topical steroids to cyclosporine or tacrolimus eye drops. In extremely rare cases, there is also the need for surgical treatment for the debridement of ulcers, as well as for advanced glaucoma and cataracts, caused by excessive prolonged use of steroid eye drops. We performed a systematic review of the literature, according to PRISMA guideline recommendations. We searched the PubMed database from January 2016 to June 2023. Search terms were Vernal, Vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and VKC. We initially identified 211 articles. After the screening process, 168 studies were eligible according to our criteria and were included in the review. In this study, we performed a systematic literature review to provide a comprehensive overview of currently available diagnostic methods, management of VKC, and its treatments...."
cornea infection,"Chronic infection of the cornea by Herpes simplex virus (HSV) continues to be an important cause of unilateral blindness. Despite considerable progress in the understanding of the virus at cellular and molecular levels, the prospect of prevention still appears to be long way off. The development of non-toxic topical antiviral agents has been an important step forward in management. However, correct diagnosis and treatment, in particular, the avoidance of inappropriate use of topical steroid remains as important as ever. This article reviews the virological and clinical aspects of HSV keratitis including the current concepts of pathogenesis and management...."
coronary atherosclerosis,"During the past decade, our understanding of the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease (CAD) has undergone a remarkable evolution. We review here how these advances have altered our concepts of and clinical approaches to both the chronic and acute phases of CAD. Previously considered a cholesterol storage disease, we currently view atherosclerosis as an inflammatory disorder. The appreciation of arterial remodeling (compensatory enlargement) has expanded attention beyond stenoses evident by angiography to encompass the biology of nonstenotic plaques. Revascularization effectively relieves ischemia, but we now recognize the need to attend to nonobstructive lesions as well. Aggressive management of modifiable risk factors reduces cardiovascular events and should accompany appropriate revascularization. We now recognize that disruption of plaques that may not produce critical stenoses causes many acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The disrupted plaque represents a ""solid-state"" stimulus to thrombosis. Alterations in circulating prothrombotic or antifibrinolytic mediators in the ""fluid phase"" of the blood can also predispose toward ACS. Recent results have established the multiplicity of ""high-risk"" plaques and the widespread nature of inflammation in patients prone to develop ACS. These findings challenge our traditional view of coronary atherosclerosis as a segmental or localized disease. Thus, treatment of ACS should involve 2 overlapping phases: first, addressing the culprit lesion, and second, aiming at rapid ""stabilization"" of other plaques that may produce recurrent events. The concept of ""interventional cardiology"" must expand beyond mechanical revascularization to embrace preventive interventions that forestall future events...."
crohn disease,"Crohn disease is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease condition characterized by skip lesions and transmural inflammation that can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. For this review article, we performed a review of articles in PubMed through February 1, 2017, by using the following Medical Subject Heading terms: crohns disease, crohn's disease, crohn disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Presenting symptoms are often variable and may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and in certain cases fevers or chills. There are 3 main disease phenotypes: inflammatory, structuring, and penetrating. In addition to the underlying disease phenotype, up to a third of patients will develop perianal involvement of their disease. In addition, in some cases, extraintestinal manifestations may develop. The diagnosis is typically made with endoscopic and/or radiologic findings. Disease management is usually with pharmacologic therapy, which is determined on the basis of disease severity and underlying disease phenotype. Although the goal of management is to control the inflammation and induce a clinical remission with pharmacologic therapy, most patients will eventually require surgery for their disease. Unfortunately, surgery is not curative and patients still require ongoing therapy even after surgery for disease recurrence. Importantly, given the risks of complications from both Crohn disease and the medications used to treat the disease process, primary care physicians play an important role in optimizing the preventative care management to reduce the risk of complications...."
cryoglobulinemia,"Cryoglobulinaemia refers to the serum presence of cryoglobulins, which are defined as immunoglobulins that precipitate at temperatures <37 °C. Type I cryoglobulinaemia consists of only one isotype or subclass of monoclonal immunoglobulin, whereas type II and type III are classified as mixed cryoglobulinaemia because they include immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM. Many lymphoproliferative, infectious and autoimmune disorders have been associated with mixed cryoglobulinaemia; however, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the aetiologic agent in most patients. The underlying mechanism of the disorder is B cell lymphoproliferation and autoantibody production. Mixed cryoglobulinaemia can cause systemic vasculitis, with manifestations ranging from purpura, arthralgia and weakness to more serious lesions with skin ulcers, neurological and renal involvement. This Primer focuses on mixed cryoglobulinaemia, which has a variable course and a prognosis that is primarily influenced by vasculitis-associated multiorgan damage. In addition, the underlying associated disease in itself may cause considerable mortality and morbidity. Treatment of cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis should be modulated according to the underlying associated disease and the severity of organ involvement and relies on antiviral treatment (for HCV infection), immunosuppression and immunotherapy, particularly anti-CD20 B cell depletion therapies...."
cryptosporidium enteritis,"Foodborne illness, the majority of which is caused by enteric infectious agents, costs global economies billions of dollars each year. The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium is particularly suited to foodborne transmission and is responsible for >8 million cases of foodborne illness annually. Procedures have been developed for sensitive detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts on fresh produce and molecular diagnostic assays have been widely used in case linkages and infection source tracking, especially during outbreak investigations. The integrated use of advanced diagnostic techniques with conventional epidemiological studies is essential to improve our understanding of the occurrence, source and epidemiology of foodborne cryptosporidiosis. The implementation of food safety management tools such as Good Hygienic Practices (GHP), Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), and Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) in industrialised nations and Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) in developing countries is central for prevention and control and foodborne cryptosporidiosis in the future...."
cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis is a genetic and multisystemic disease. The main comorbidity in adulthood is respiratory involvement, with the presence of bronchiectasis, chronic bronchial infection and airflow obstruction. Until a decade ago, treatments were aimed at favoring secretion drainage, reducing respiratory exacerbations, controlling chronic bronchial infection and slowing functional deterioration, but with the advent of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, the cystic fibrosis paradigm has changed. This novel treatment goes a step further in the management of this disease, it is able to improve the production of defective CFTR protein and increase its expression on the cell surface, thus achieving a better functioning of ion exchange, fluidizing respiratory secretions and reducing airflow obstruction. In addition, there are currently different lines of research aimed at correcting the genetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis...."
cystitis - acute,"A Panel of International Experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations...."
cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a betaherpesvirus with a global seroprevalence of 60-90%. HCMV is the leading cause of congenital infections and poses a great health risk to immunocompromised individuals. Although HCMV infection is typically asymptomatic in the immunocompetent population, infection can result in mononucleosis and has also been associated with the development of certain cancers, as well as chronic inflammatory diseases such as various cardiovascular diseases. In immunocompromised patients, including AIDS patients, transplant recipients, and developing fetuses, HCMV infection is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Currently there is no vaccine for HCMV and there is a need for new pharmacological treatments. Ongoing research seeks to further define the complex aspects of HCMV pathogenesis, which could potentially lead to the generation of new therapeutics to mitigate the disease states associated with HCMV infection. The following chapter reviews the advancements in our understanding of HCMV pathogenesis in the immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts...."
degenerative disc disease,"Lumbar disc degeneration is one of the leading causes of chronic low back pain. The degenerative cascade is often initiated by an imbalance between catabolic and anabolic processes in the intervertebral discs. As a consequence of extracellular matrix degradation, neoinnervation and neovascularization take place. Ultimately, this degenerative process results in disc bulging and loss of nucleus pulposus and water content and subsequent loss of disc height. Most patients respond to conservative management and surgical interventions well initially, yet a significant number of patients continue to suffer from chronic low back pain. Because of the high prevalence of long-term discogenic pain, regenerative biological therapies, including gene therapies, growth factors, cellular-based injections, and tissue-engineered constructs, have attracted significant attention in light of their potential to directly address the degenerative process. Understanding the pathophysiology of degenerative disc disease is important in both refining existing technologies and developing innovative techniques to reverse the degenerative processes in the discs. In this review, we aimed to cover the underlying pathophysiology of degenerative disc disease as well as its associated risk factors and give a comprehensive summary about the developmental, structural, radiological, and biomechanical properties of human intervertebral discs...."
dependent personality disorder,"Dependent personality disorder (DPD) has evolved from an abstract idea rooted in a historic and psychoanalytic context to a codified diagnosis in the DSM-IV-TR. This comprehensive review paper chronicles the evolution of DPD through each version of the DSM. Major topics relevant to the disorder are also investigated, including gender and cultural considerations, stability and manifestations of DPD across different developmental stages, comorbidity issues, and others. The purpose of this review is to provide a broad yet comprehensive examination of the complex angles of maladaptive dependency and to identify essential next steps in furthering our knowledge of this disorder. The paper concludes with a discussion of shortcomings in the body of research relevant to DPD, along with specific suggestions for improvement in this field of study...."
diabetic kidney disease,"Diabetes is a major public health challenge and diabetic kidney disease (DKD), a broader diagnostic term than diabetic nephropathy, is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease in the United States and worldwide. A better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of DKD, and recent clinical trials testing new therapeutic interventions, have shown promising results to curb this epidemic. Given the global health burden of DKD, it is extremely important to prioritize prevention, early recognition, referral, and aggressive management of DKD in the primary care setting...."
dislocation of the finger,"The basal joint complex of the thumb provides the framework necessary for function of the human hand. Although its unique saddle articulation allows for a wide range of motion necessary for routine function of the hand, it is rendered inherently unstable because of poor bony congruency and reliance on its capsuloligamentous support. Painful instability of this joint can stem from several causes including traumatic dislocation, various hypermobility conditions, and chronic overuse and microtrauma. A thorough history and examination as well adequate imaging is necessary for proper evaluation of instability. Treatment options range from nonoperative modalities to surgery, which entails closed, percutaneous, or open reduction with numerous ligament repair and reconstruction techniques. Arthroscopy can also serve to be a useful adjunct for assessment of the joint and stabilization of the critical capsuloligamentous structures. This review outlines the critical osseous and soft-tissue anatomy surrounding the thumb carpometacarpal joint, the key points in evaluating patients presenting with acute traumatic and chronic thumb carpometacarpal instability without fracture or arthritis, and reviews both nonoperative and operative treatments of this injury...."
dislocation of the wrist,"Carpal dislocations result from sequential disruption of the complex relationship between the bones and ligaments of the wrist. Injuries to the carpus occur via predictable mechanisms, an understanding of which is critical to identify and treat these frequently missed patterns of injury and to avoid the sequela of chronic instability. Lunate dislocations are by far the most common, but isolated dislocation of other carpal bones can also occur. Open reduction and internal fixation still remains the gold standard for treatment regardless of the debate around the specific approaches. These high-energy injuries are associated with significant long-term morbidity even when identified promptly and appropriately treated. This review will focus on the evaluation and management of common forms of carpal dislocations...."
drug reaction,"We define an adverse drug reaction as ""an appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product, which predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product."" Such reactions are currently reported by use of WHO's Adverse Reaction Terminology, which will eventually become a subset of the International Classification of Diseases. Adverse drug reactions are classified into six types (with mnemonics): dose-related (Augmented), non-dose-related (Bizarre), dose-related and time-related (Chronic), time-related (Delayed), withdrawal (End of use), and failure of therapy (Failure). Timing, the pattern of illness, the results of investigations, and rechallenge can help attribute causality to a suspected adverse drug reaction. Management includes withdrawal of the drug if possible and specific treatment of its effects. Suspected adverse drug reactions should be reported. Surveillance methods can detect reactions and prove associations...."
dry eye of unknown cause,"Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology that mainly involves exocrine glands. Patients present with dry mouth and eyes, fever, arthralgia, and other systemic symptoms. In severe cases, the quality of life of patients is affected. At present, there is no cure for SS, and the treatment options are extremely limited. In recent years, studies of patients and animal models have identified abnormalities of immune cell function and cytokines to be involved in SS. A systematic review of the literature may clarify the etiology and pathogenesis of SS, as well as provide a theoretical basis for the development of new drugs for the treatment of SS...."
dysthymic disorder,"Persistent depressive disorder is a chronic mood disorder that is common and often more disabling than episodic major depression. In DSM-5, the term subsumes several chronic depressive presentations, including dysthymia with or without superimposed major depressive episodes, chronic major depression, and recurrent major depression without recovery between episodes. Dysthymia can be difficult to detect in psychiatric and primary care settings until it intensifies in the form of a superimposed major depressive episode. Although information is scarce concerning the cause of persistent depressive disorder including dysthymia, the causation is likely to be multifactorial. In this narrative Review, we discuss current knowledge about the nosology and neurobiological basis of dysthymia and persistent depressive disorder, emphasising a dimensional perspective based on course for further research. We also review new developments in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for persistent depressive disorder, and propose a tailored, modular approach to accommodate its multifaceted nature...."
eczema,"Atopic dermatitis, commonly known as eczema, is a common chronic, relapsing skin disease characterized by pruritus, disrupted epidermal barrier function, and immunoglobulin E-mediated sensitization to food and environmental allergens. Atopic dermatitis is a complex disease that arises from interactions between genes and the environment. Loci on several chromosomes have been identified, including a family of epithelium-related genes called the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1q21. Mutations in filaggrin, a key protein in epidermal differentiation, have also been identified in early-onset and severe atopic dermatitis. There are 3 classical stages of eczema: infantile, childhood, and adulthood. The spectrum of eczema presentation varies widely from a variant that only affect the hand to major forms where a patient presents with erythroderma. The acute and subacute lesions of atopic dermatitis are often characterized by intensely pruritic, erythematous papules and vesicles with excoriations and a serous exudate. Chronic atopic dermatitis is exemplified by lichenified plaques and papules with excoriations. Atopic dermatitis patients are also at higher risk for skin infections, including bacterial and viral superinfections. Conventional therapy includes avoidance of irritants and potential allergens, as well as continued hydration of the skin with thick emollients. Topical corticosteroids and topical immunomodulators are often used primarily. Other therapies including phototherapy, antimicrobials, antihistamines, and systemic immunosuppressives are also options in certain situations...."
endometrial hyperplasia,"The objectives of this Clinical Expert Series on endometrial hyperplasia are to review the etiology and risk factors, histologic classification and subtypes, malignant progression risks, prevention options, and to outline both surgical and nonsurgical treatment options. Abnormal uterine and postmenopausal bleeding remain the hallmark of endometrial pathology, and up to 10-20% of postmenopausal bleeding will be either hyperplasia or cancer; thus, immediate evaluation of any abnormal bleeding with either tissue procurement for pathology or imaging should be undertaken. Although anyone with a uterus may develop atypical hyperplasia, also known as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN), genetic predispositions (eg, Lynch syndrome), obesity, chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovarian syndrome all markedly increase these risks, whereas use of oral contraceptive pills or progesterone-containing intrauterine devices will decrease the risk. An EIN diagnosis carries a high risk of concomitant endometrial cancer or eventual progression to cancer in the absence of treatment. The definitive and curative treatment for EIN remains hysterectomy; however, the obesity epidemic, the potential desire for fertility-sparing treatments, the recognition of varying rates of malignant transformation, medical comorbidities, and an aging population all may factor into decisions to employ nonsurgical treatment modalities...."
endometriosis,"Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which causes pelvic pain and infertility. This disease should be viewed as a public health problem with a major effect on the quality of life of women as well as being a substantial economic burden. In light of the considerable progress with diagnostic imaging (for example, transvaginal ultrasound and MRI), exploratory laparoscopy should no longer be used to diagnose endometriotic lesions. Instead, diagnosis of endometriosis should be based on a structured process involving the combination of patient interviews, clinical examination and imaging. Notably, a diagnosis of endometriosis often leads to immediate surgery. Therefore, rethinking the diagnosis and management of endometriosis is warranted. Instead of assessing endometriosis on the day of the diagnosis, gynaecologists should consider the patient's 'endometriosis life'. Medical treatment is the first-line therapeutic option for patients with pelvic pain and no desire for immediate pregnancy. In women with infertility, careful consideration should be made regarding whether to provide assisted reproductive technologies prior to performing endometriosis surgery. Modern endometriosis management should be individualized with a patient-centred, multi-modal and interdisciplinary integrated approach...."
endometritis,"Endometritis is defined as an infection or inflammation of the endometrium. Endometritis is of two types: acute and chronic. Acute endometritis is the symptomatic acute inflammation of the endometrium, which upon examination with a microscope shows micro-abscess and neutrophil invasion in the superficial endometrium. One of its most common manifestations is postpartum endometritis. Chronic endometritis is a silent disease usually diagnosed on the workup of secondary amenorrhoea and infertility. An important cause of chronic endometritis is tuberculosis, especially in developing nations. Chronic and acute endometritis have been associated with poor reproductive outcomes. Worse outcomes have been reported for individuals with chronic endometritis. This is a scoping review of endometritis and its impact on fertility...."
epididymitis,"Epididymitis may be acute (symptoms last less than 6 weeks) or chronic (more than 3 months). Acute epididymitis is almost always unilateral. In sexually active men under 35 years of age, acute epididymitis is frequently caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and less frequently by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and is usually associated with overt or subclinical urethritis. Acute epididymitis in older men, children or following urinary tract instrumentation is commonly caused by gram-negative bacilli. The epididymis is sometimes the site of metastatic infection, such as tuberculosis. It is important to differentiate epididymitis from other causes for acute scrotum, such as testicular torsion and tumor. The cause of acute scrotum especially in children cannot always be identified. Therefore, Doppler ultrasonography and radionuclide scans are often used. In infants and young boys, genitourinary abnormalities are causative factors, and therefore should be excluded by imaging. Supportive measures and antimicrobial agents are the mainstay of therapy...."
episcleritis,"Scleritis and episcleritis are rare ocular inflammatory diseases but deserve to be known by internists because of their frequent association with systemic autoimmune diseases. It is important to distinguish them between because their prognosis, therapeutic management and potential complications are very different. Episcleritis represents a superficial ocular inflammation with usually benign visual prognosis, no complication with local treatment, and is associated with a systemic autoimmune disease in rare cases. In contrast, scleritis is a potentially serious ophthalmological condition that can threaten the visual prognosis in the absence of appropriate systemic treatment. It is associated with an underlying disease in 40-50% of cases, in particular a systemic autoimmune disease (25-35% of cases) or an infectious cause (5-10% of cases). Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic vasculitides, particularly antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides, are the main autoimmune causes of scleritis and episcleritis. Scleritis can reveal the underlying autoimmune disease and requires systematic etiological investigations. Aggressive, complicated, refractory forms or those associated with a systemic autoimmune disease require glucocorticoids or even immunosuppressants, and close collaboration between ophthalmologists and internists is required. The development of biologic agents offers new effective therapeutic tools in the management of these difficult cases...."
erectile dysfunction,"Erectile dysfunction is a common condition. Many men do not self-report erectile dysfunction symptoms; thus, physicians must ask about sexual health and function to elicit concerns. Although the impact of untreated erectile dysfunction on quality of life should prompt physicians to ask about symptoms, so should the presence of cardiac and metabolic disease. Diagnosis of erectile dysfunction is made in the primary care office, and patients may be treated with oral, intraurethral, or intracavernosal medications; vacuum devices; or penile prosthesis. Treatment should be guided by patient preference with a goal of improving quality of life and mitigating chronic disease risk...."
erythroderma,"Erythroderma (exfoliative dermatitis), first described by Von Hebra in 1868, manifests as a cutaneous inflammatory state, with associated skin barrier and metabolic dysfunctions. The annual incidence of erythroderma is estimated to be 1-2 per 100 000 population in Europe with a male preponderance. Erythroderma may present at birth, or may develop acutely or insidiously (due to progression of an underlying primary pathology, including malignancy). Although there is a broad range of diseases that associate with erythroderma, the vast majority of cases result from pre-existing and chronic dermatoses. In the first part of this two-part concise review, we explore the underlying causes, clinical presentation, pathogenesis and investigation of erythroderma, and suggest potential treatment targets for erythroderma with unknown causes...."
esophagitis,"Esophageal candidiasis (EC) is the most common type of infectious esophagitis. In the gastrointestinal tract, the esophagus is the second most susceptible to candida infection, only after the oropharynx. Immunocompromised patients are most at risk, including patients with HIV/AIDS, leukemia, diabetics, and those who are receiving corticosteroids, radiation, and chemotherapy. Another group includes those who used antibiotics frequently and those who have esophageal motility disorder (cardiac achalasia and scleroderma). Patients complained of pain on swallowing, difficulty swallowing, and pain behind the sternum. On physical examination, there is a plaque that often occurs together with oral thrush. Endoscopic examination is the best approach to diagnose this disease by directly observing the white mucosal plaque-like lesions and exudates adherent to the mucosa. These adherent lesions cannot be washed off with water from irrigation. This disease is confirmed histologically by taking the biopsy or brushings of yeast and pseudohyphae invading mucosal cells. The treatment is by systemic antifungal drugs given orally in a defined course. It is important to differentiate esophageal candidiasis from other forms of infectious esophagitis such as cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, medication-induced esophagitis, radiation-induced esophageal injury, and inflammatory conditions such as eosinophilic esophagitis. Except for a few complications such as necrotizing esophageal candidiasis, fistula, and sepsis, the prognosis of esophageal candidiasis has been good...."
familial dysautonomia,"Familial dysautonomia (FD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN, type 3) expressed at birth with profound sensory loss and early death. The FD founder mutation in the ELP1 gene arose within the Ashkenazi Jews in the sixteenth century and is present in 1:30 Jews of European ancestry. The mutation yield a tissue-specific skipping of exon 20 and a loss of function of the elongator-1 protein (ELP1), which is essential for the development and survival of neurons. Patients with FD produce variable amounts of ELP1 in different tissues, with the brain producing mostly mutant transcripts. Patients have excessive blood pressure variability due to the failure of the IXth and Xth cranial nerves to carry baroreceptor signals. Neurogenic dysphagia causes frequent aspiration leading to chronic pulmonary disease. Characteristic hyperadrenergic ""autonomic crises"" consisting of brisk episodes of severe hypertension, tachycardia, skin blotching, retching, and vomiting occur in all patients. Progressive features of the disease include retinal nerve fiber loss and blindness, and proprioceptive ataxia with severe gait impairment. Chemoreflex failure may explain the high frequency of sudden death in sleep. Although 99.5% of patients are homozygous for the founder mutation, phenotypic severity varies, suggesting that modifier genes impact expression. Medical management is currently symptomatic and preventive. Disease-modifying therapies are close to clinical testing. Endpoints to measure efficacy have been developed, and the ELP1 levels are a good surrogate endpoint for target engagement. Early intervention may be critical for treatment to be successful...."
familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency,"The chylomicronemia syndrome is characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia and fasting chylomicronemia and predisposes affected individuals to acute pancreatitis. When due to very rare monogenic mutations in the genes encoding the enzyme, lipoprotein lipase, or its regulators, APOC2, APOA5, GPIHBP1, and LMF1, it is referred to as the familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Much more frequently, the chylomicronemia syndrome results from a cluster of minor genetic variants causing polygenic hypertriglyceridemia, which is exacerbated by conditions or medications which increase triglyceride levels beyond the saturation point of triglyceride removal systems. This situation is termed the multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome. These aggravating factors include common conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes, overweight and obesity, alcohol excess, chronic kidney disease and pregnancy and several medications, including diuretics, non-selective beta blockers, estrogenic compounds, corticosteroids, protease inhibitors, immunosuppressives, antipsychotics, antidepressants, retinoids, L-asparaginase, and propofol. A third uncommon cause of the chylomicronemia syndrome is familial forms of partial lipodystrophy. Development of pancreatitis is the most feared complication of the chylomicronemia syndrome, but the risk of cardiovascular disease as well as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is also increased. Treatment consists of dietary fat restriction and weight reduction combined with the use of triglyceride lowering medications such as fibrates, omega 3 fatty acids and niacin. Effective management of aggravating factors such as improving diabetes control, discontinuing alcohol and replacing or reducing the dose of medications that raise triglyceride levels is essential. Importantly, many if not most cases of the chylomicronemia syndrome can be prevented by effective identification of polygenic hypertriglyceridemia in people with conditions that increase its likelihood or before starting medications that may increase triglyceride levels. Several new pharmacotherapeutic agents are being tested that are likely to considerably improve treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in people at risk...."
fecal impaction,"Constipation in children is usually functional constipation without an organic cause. Organic causes of constipation in children, which include Hirschsprung disease, cystic fibrosis, and spinal cord abnormalities, commonly present with red flag signs and symptoms. A history and physical examination can diagnose functional constipation using the Rome IV diagnostic criteria. The first goal of managing constipation is to treat fecal impaction, and then maintenance therapy is used to prevent a recurrence. Polyethylene glycol is the first-line treatment for constipation. Second-line options include lactulose and enemas. Increasing dietary fiber and fluid intake above usual daily recommendations and adding probiotics provide no additional benefits for treating constipation. Frequent follow-up visits and referrals to a psychologist can assist in reaching some treatment goals. Clinicians should educate caregivers about the chronic course of functional constipation, frequent relapses, and the potential for prolonged therapy. Clinicians should acknowledge caregivers' specific challenges and the negative effects of constipation on the child's quality of life. Referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist is recommended when there is a concern for organic causes or constipation persists despite adequate therapy...."
flu,"Seasonal influenza, or flu, is an airborne respiratory virus that occurs every year in the fall to early spring in the United States. The virus is highly contagious and symptoms can run from mild to severe. In some populations (very young, individuals with chronic comorbid conditions, immunocompromised individuals of all ages, pregnant women, and frail older adults), the virus can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. In a majority of cases, seasonal influenza is preventable through safe and readily available vaccinations...."
fracture of the neck,"Whiplash injury is a common trauma of the cervical spine which usually occurs during motor vehicle accidents, especially involving rear-end collisions. The trauma typically results from a sudden biphasic movement of the head and cervical spine (reclination followed by inclination), which may cause an injury of bony, muscular and ligamentous elements. The most common symptoms of whiplash injury are pain, stiffness and tenderness of the neck, which occur with a latency of several hours and may become chronic in some patients. The imaging studies rarely demonstrate morphological changes associated with trauma and there are also no specific imaging findings in whiplash injuries. Plain films and computed tomography are used in acute trauma workup to exclude bony injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may demonstrate occult fractures, bone contusions as well as muscular and ligamentous posttraumatic lesions. The whiplash injuries are classified clinically according to Quebec Task Force-Grading, depending on the symptom severity...."
fungal arthritis,"Osteoarticular mycoses are chronic debilitating infections that require extended courses of antifungal therapy and may warrant expert surgical intervention. As there has been no comprehensive review of these diseases, the International Consortium for Osteoarticular Mycoses prepared a definitive treatise for this important class of infections. Among the etiologies of osteoarticular mycoses are Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Mucorales, dematiaceous fungi, non-Aspergillus hyaline molds, and endemic mycoses, including those caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Coccidioides species. This review analyzes the history, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, inflammatory biomarkers, diagnostic imaging modalities, treatments, and outcomes of osteomyelitis and septic arthritis caused by these organisms. Candida osteomyelitis and Candida arthritis are associated with greater events of hematogenous dissemination than those of most other osteoarticular mycoses. Traumatic inoculation is more commonly associated with osteoarticular mycoses caused by Aspergillus and non-Aspergillus molds. Synovial fluid cultures are highly sensitive in the detection of Candida and Aspergillus arthritis. Relapsed infection, particularly in Candida arthritis, may develop in relation to an inadequate duration of therapy. Overall mortality reflects survival from disseminated infection and underlying host factors...."
g6pd enzyme deficiency,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common human enzyme defect, being present in more than 400 million people worldwide. The global distribution of this disorder is remarkably similar to that of malaria, lending support to the so-called malaria protection hypothesis. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked, hereditary genetic defect due to mutations in the G6PD gene, which cause functional variants with many biochemical and clinical phenotypes. About 140 mutations have been described: most are single base changes, leading to aminoacid substitutions. The most frequent clinical manifestations of G6PD deficiency are neonatal jaundice, and acute haemolytic anaemia, which is usually triggered by an exogenous agent. Some G6PD variants cause chronic haemolysis, leading to congenital non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia. The most effective management of G6PD deficiency is to prevent haemolysis by avoiding oxidative stress. Screening programmes for the disorder are undertaken, depending on the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in a particular community...."
galactorrhea of unknown cause,"An interesting neurological syndrome, characterized by recurrent optic neuritis, cervical myelopathy from syringomyelia, paraparesis, amenorrhea-galactorrhea, and other endocrine problems, has been described among young black women in the French West Indies. The etiology remains unknown, but possible links with Devic's disease, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and neurotoxicity from quinolines in Annona muricata teas have been postulated. The largest epidemic of neuropathy in this century occurred in Cuba in 1991-1994. Clinical features and etiologic studies are reviewed. Its primary cause was nutritional. A similar epidemic was recently described in Tanzania. A number of infectious neuropathies and myopathies are reviewed, including leprosy, tuberculosis, hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, Lassa, Argentinean and Bolivian arenaviruses), the human retrovirus human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I, Lyme disease and postimmunization neuropathies. The tropics continue to contribute interesting and important clinical conditions that may illuminate the etiopathiogenesis of other common disorders...."
gallstones,"Gallstones grow inside the gallbladder or biliary tract. These stones can be asymptomatic or symptomatic; only gallstones with symptoms or complications are defined as gallstone disease. Based on their composition, gallstones are classified into cholesterol gallstones, which represent the predominant entity, and bilirubin ('pigment') stones. Black pigment stones can be caused by chronic haemolysis; brown pigment stones typically develop in obstructed and infected bile ducts. For treatment, localization of the gallstones in the biliary tract is more relevant than composition. Overall, up to 20% of adults develop gallstones and >20% of those develop symptoms or complications. Risk factors for gallstones are female sex, age, pregnancy, physical inactivity, obesity and overnutrition. Factors involved in metabolic syndrome increase the risk of developing gallstones and form the basis of primary prevention by lifestyle changes. Common mutations in the hepatic cholesterol transporter ABCG8 confer most of the genetic risk of developing gallstones, which accounts for ∼25% of the total risk. Diagnosis is mainly based on clinical symptoms, abdominal ultrasonography and liver biochemistry tests. Symptoms often precede the onset of the three common and potentially life-threatening complications of gallstones (acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis and biliary pancreatitis). Although our knowledge on the genetics and pathophysiology of gallstones has expanded recently, current treatment algorithms remain predominantly invasive and are based on surgery. Hence, our future efforts should focus on novel preventive strategies to overcome the onset of gallstones in at-risk patients in particular, but also in the population in general...."
gastritis,"Prevalence of chronic gastritis has markedly declined in developed populations during the past decades. However, chronic gastritis is still one of the most common serious pandemic infections with such severe killing sequelae as peptic ulcer or gastric cancer. Globally, on average, even more than half of people may have a chronic gastritis at present. Helicobacter pylori infection in childhood is the main cause of chronic gastritis, which microbial origin is the key for the understanding of the bizarre epidemiology and course of the disease. A life-long and aggressive inflammation in gastritis results in destruction (atrophic gastritis) of stomach mucosa with time (years and decades). The progressive worsening of atrophic gastritis results subsequently in dysfunctions of stomach mucosa. Atrophic gastritis will finally end up in a permanently acid-free stomach in the most extreme cases. Severe atrophic gastritis and acid-free stomach are the highest independent risk conditions for gastric cancer known so far. In addition to the risks of malignancy and peptic ulcer, acid-free stomach and severe forms of atrophic gastritis may associate with failures in absorption of essential vitamins, like vitamin B12, micronutrients (like iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc), diet and medicines...."
gingivostomatitis,"Feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS) is a debilitating disease for cats and a challenge for veterinarians and cat caregivers alike. Recent literature indicates that the disease is immune-mediated in nature and likely associated with a chronic viral infection in patients with higher alpha diversity of their subgingival microbiome. The immune-mediated nature of FCGS includes both local as well as systemic effects, and the transcriptomic analysis of affected patients supports these findings...."
glomerulonephritis,"Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) is a leading cause of acute glomerulonephritis in children. The presentation of PIGN can vary from asymptomatic microscopic hematuria incidentally detected on routine urinalysis to nephritic syndrome and a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Treatment involves supportive care with salt and water restriction, and the use of diuretic and/or antihypertensive medication, depending on the severity of fluid retention and the presence of hypertension. PIGN resolves completely and spontaneously in most children, and the long-term outcomes are typically good with preserved renal function and no recurrence...."
gout,"Gout is a common and treatable disease caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in articular and non-articular structures. Increased concentration of serum urate (hyperuricaemia) is the most important risk factor for the development of gout. Serum urate is regulated by urate transporters in the kidney and gut, particularly GLUT9 (SLC2A9), URAT1 (SLC22A12), and ABCG2. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by monosodium urate crystals with release of IL-1β plays a major role in the initiation of the gout flare; aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps are important in the resolution phase. Although presenting as an intermittent flaring condition, gout is a chronic disease. Long-term urate lowering therapy (eg, allopurinol) leads to the dissolution of monosodium urate crystals, ultimately resulting in the prevention of gout flares and tophi and in improved quality of life. Strategies such as nurse-led care are effective in delivering high-quality gout care and lead to major improvements in patient outcomes...."
granuloma inguinale,"Donovanosis is a chronic, progressive, and indolent bacterial disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes of the genital and perigenital regions, often associated with sexual transmission, and with low infectivity. The malignant transformation of donovanosis lesions occurs exceptionally, as is usually seen in long-term ulcerations...."
gynecomastia,"Enlargement of breasts among boys is termed gynecomastia. This could be due to an alteration in the androgen-estrogen ratio along with the effects of other hormones including growth hormone, insulin like growth factor 1, prolactin, and other factors affecting aromatase enzyme. The common causes of gynecomastia are pubertal gynecomastia, obesity, drugs and hypogonadism. Several other diseases including liver or renal failure, thyrotoxicosis, Klinefelter syndrome, tumors and environmental pollutants can cause gynecomastia. History and clinical examination will help formulate targeted investigations and management. The factors to be evaluated in these include examination of breasts and testes, in addition to other parts of systemic examination. Treatment of underlying disorders can improve gynecomastia, such as use of testosterone in hypogonadism. Some boys may not need any intervention as gynecomastia may resolve on its own. Medical management is useful in simple gynecomastia. Tamoxifen has been tried successfully in adolescents with gynecomastia. Other drugs including clomiphene, danazol, letrozole and anastrozole have not been consistently useful in this age group. In severe chronic gynecomastia, surgery is the treatment of choice...."
headache after lumbar puncture,"Diagnostic Lumbar Puncture is one of the most commonly performed invasive tests in clinical medicine. Evaluation of an acute headache and investigation of inflammatory or infectious disease of the nervous system are the most common indications. Serious complications are rare, and correct technique will minimise diagnostic error and maximise patient comfort. We review the technique of diagnostic Lumbar Puncture including anatomy, needle selection, needle insertion, measurement of opening pressure, Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) specimen handling and after care. We also make some quality improvement suggestions for those designing services incorporating diagnostic Lumbar Puncture...."
hemarthrosis,"Hemophilia A and B are rare X-linked inherited bleeding disorders caused by complete or partial deficiency in or the absence of coagulation factors VIII and IX. Recurrent joint bleeding (hemarthrosis) is the most frequent clinical manifestation of severe hemophilia. Unless appropriately managed, even subclinical hemarthrosis can lead to the development of hemophilic arthropathy, a disabling condition characterized by joint remodelling, chronic pain, and a reduced quality of life, and eventually requires joint replacement. Given the lack of specific treatments to reduce blood-induced synovitis, the prevention of bleeding is pivotal to the maintenance of joint health. Prophylactic coagulation factor replacement therapy using extended half-life recombinant drugs has significantly improved patients' quality of life by reducing the burden of intravenous injections, and the more recent introduction of nonreplacement therapies such as subcutaneous emicizumab injections has improved treatment adherence and led to the greater protection of patients with hemophilia A. However, despite these advances, chronic arthropathy is still a significant problem. The introduction of point-of-care ultrasound imaging has improved the diagnosis of acute hemarthrosis and early hemophilic arthropathy, and allowed the better monitoring of progressive joint damage, but further research into the underlying mechanisms of the disease is required to allow the development of more targeted treatment. In the meantime, patient management should be based on the risk factors for the onset and progression of arthropathy of each individual patient, and all patients should be collaboratively cared for by multidisciplinary teams of hematologists, rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons, and physiotherapists at comprehensive hemophilia treatment centers...."
hepatorenal syndrome,"Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), the extreme manifestation of renal impairment in patients with cirrhosis, is characterized by reduction in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Hepatorenal syndrome is diagnosed when kidney function is reduced but evidence of intrinsic kidney disease, such as hematuria, proteinuria, or abnormal kidney ultrasonography, is absent. Unlike other causes of acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatorenal syndrome results from functional changes in the renal circulation and is potentially reversible with liver transplantation or vasoconstrictor drugs. Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome are recognized depending on the acuity and progression of kidney injury. The first represents an acute impairment of kidney function, HRS-AKI, whereas the second represents a more chronic kidney dysfunction, HRS-CKD (chronic kidney disease). In this review, we provide critical insight into the definition, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of hepatorenal syndrome...."
herniated(slipped) disk,"It is wrong to believe that back pain only burdens adults: the yearly incidence during growth ranges from 10-20%, continuously increasing from childhood to adolescence. Rapid growth-related muscular dysbalance and insufficiency, poor physical condition in an increasingly sedentary adolescent community or - vice versa - high level sports activities, account for the most prevalent functional pain syndromes. In contrast to adults the correlation of radiographic findings with pain is high: the younger the patient, the higher the probability to establish a rare morphologic cause such as benign or malignant tumours, congenital malformations and infections. In children younger than 5 years old, the likelihood is more than 50%. The following red flags should lower the threshold for a quick in-depth analysis of the problem: Age of the patient <5 years, acute trauma, functional limitation for daily activities, irradiating pain, loss of weight, duration >4 weeks, history of tumour, exposition to tuberculosis, night pain and fever. High level sport equals a biomechanical field test which reveals the biologic individual response of the growing spine to the sports-related forces. Symptomatic or asymptomatic inhibitory or stimulatory growth disturbances like Scheuermann disease, scoliosis or fatigue fractures represent the most frequent pathomorphologies. They usually occur at the disk-growth plate compound: intraspongious disk herniation, diminuition of anterior growth with vertebral wedging and apophyseal ring fractures often occur when the biomechanical impacts exceed the mechanical resistance of the cartilaginous endplates. Spondylolysis is a benign condition which rarely becomes symptomatic and responds well to conservative measures. Associated slippage of L5 on S1 is frequent but rarely progresses. The pubertal spinal growth spurt is the main risk factor for further slippage, whereas sports activity - even at a high level - is not. Therefore, the athlete should only be precluded from training if pain persists or in case of high grade slips. Perturbance of the sagittal profile with increase of lumbar lordosis, flattening of the thoracic spine and retroflexion of the pelvis with hamstrings contractures are strong signs for a grade IV olisthesis or spondyloptosis with subsequent lumbosacral kyphosis. Idiopathic scoliosis is not related to pain unless it is a marked (thoraco-) lumbar curve or if there is an underlying spinal cord pathology. Chronic back pain is an under recognised entity characterised by its duration (>3 months or recurrence within 3 months) and its social impacts such as isolation and absence from school or work. It represents an independent disease, uncoupled from any initial trigger. Multimodal therapeutic strategies are more successful than isolated, somatising orthopaedic treatment. Primary and secondary preventive active measures for the physically passive adolescents, regular sports medical check-up's for the young high level athletes,..."
hidradenitis suppurativa,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an inflammatory disorder that is characterized by chronic deep-seated nodules, abscesses, fistulae, sinus tracts, and scars in the axilla, inguinal area, submammary folds, and perianal area. This disfiguring condition is accompanied by pain, embarrassment, and a significantly decreased quality of life. Although the mechanism of HS has not been entirely elucidated, lesion formation is believed to center around follicular hyperkeratosis within the pilosebaceous-apocrine unit. Recent research has provided new insight into the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of HS, helping close some existing knowledge gaps in the development of this condition. The first article in this continuing medical education series reviews HS epidemiology, clinical presentation, and classification. We also provide an update on the most recent understanding of HS pathogenesis, including the central role of inflammatory cytokines and other contributing factors, such as genetics, hormones, and pathogenic microorganisms...."
high potassium level,"The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing with the aging of populations worldwide. As kidney function declines, the accumulation of metabolic waste products and excessive electrolytes can significantly impair the health of patients with CKD. As nutritional management of patients with CKD is thought to control uremic symptoms and provide beneficial effects on the progression of kidney dysfunction, the diet of patients with CKD should be an important consideration in their care. Many guidelines recommend limiting protein intake in these patients, as high-protein diets aggravate kidney dysfunction. Excess sodium may be associated with CKD progression and all-cause mortality and, therefore, limiting salt intake is generally recommended. Low potassium is associated with muscle weakness and hypertension, whereas high potassium is associated with cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore, recent guidelines recommend adjusting dietary potassium intake on an individual basis to maintain serum potassium levels within the normal range. Appropriate dietary calcium intake is recommended to maintain calcium balance in patients with CKD G3, G4. Given the many dietary considerations for patients with CKD, effective nutritional management is challenging. Individualized strategies are needed to ensure the best outcome for patients with CKD...."
hives,"This update and revision of the international guideline for urticaria was developed following the methods recommended by Cochrane and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. It is a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA²LEN) and its Urticaria and Angioedema Centers of Reference and Excellence (UCAREs and ACAREs), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF; EuroGuiDerm), and the Asia Pacific Association of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology with the participation of 64 delegates of 50 national and international societies and from 31 countries. The consensus conference was held on 3 December 2020. This guideline was acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS). Urticaria is a frequent, mast cell-driven disease that presents with wheals, angioedema, or both. The lifetime prevalence for acute urticaria is approximately 20%. Chronic spontaneous or inducible urticaria is disabling, impairs quality of life, and affects performance at work and school. This updated version of the international guideline for urticaria covers the definition and classification of urticaria and outlines expert-guided and evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the different subtypes of urticaria...."
human immunodeficiency virus infection (hiv),"This article describes the various non-neoplastic lymphadenopathies that occur in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), before or during the stage of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The stages that develop during the HIV infection include: primary infection (acute infection, spread of the virus, development of host immune response, and acute retroviral syndrome), chronic infection or clinical latency, and finally, the AIDS stage. Non-neoplastic lymphadenopathies can occur at any of these phases of the infection and are due to multiple causes that can be divided into infectious causes (bacterial, fungal, parasitic, viral), and reactive causes (persistent generalized lymphadenopathy and a variety of situations that they also occur in immunocompetent people such as Castleman's disease and Kikuchi-Fujimoto's disease, among others). The general, histological and immunophenotypic characteristics of these pathologies are described...."
hydrocephalus,"Hydrocephalus is a serious condition that affects patients of all ages, resulting from a multitude of causes. While the etiologies of hydrocephalus are numerous, many of the acute and chronic symptoms of the condition are shared. These symptoms include disorientation and pain (headaches), cognitive and developmental changes, vision and sleep disturbances, and gait abnormalities. This collective group of symptoms combined with the effectiveness of CSF diversion as a surgical intervention for many types of the condition suggest that the various etiologies may share common cellular and molecular dysfunctions. The incidence rate of pediatric hydrocephalus is approximately 0.1-0.6% of live births, making it as common as Down syndrome in infants. Diagnosis and treatment of various forms of adult hydrocephalus remain understudied and underreported. Surgical interventions to treat hydrocephalus, though lifesaving, have a high incidence of failure. Previously tested pharmacotherapies for the treatment of hydrocephalus have resulted in net zero or negative outcomes for patients potentially due to the lack of understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of hydrocephalus. Very few well-validated drug targets have been proposed for therapy; most of these have been within the last 5 years. Within the last 50 years, there have been only incremental improvements in surgical treatments for hydrocephalus, and there has been little progress made towards prevention or cure. This demonstrates the need to develop nonsurgical interventions for the treatment of hydrocephalus regardless of etiology. The development of new treatment paradigms relies heavily on investment in researching the common molecular mechanisms that contribute to all of the forms of hydrocephalus, and requires the concerted support of patient advocacy organizations, government- and private-funded research, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, the medical device industry, and the vast network of healthcare professionals...."
hyperkalemia,"Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs...."
hypernatremia,"Hypernatremia is an occasionally encountered electrolyte disorder, which may lead to fatal consequences under improper management. Hypernatremia is a disorder of the homeostatic status regarding body water and sodium contents. This imbalance is the basis for the diagnostic approach to hypernatremia. We summarize the eight diagnostic steps of the traditional approach and introduce new biomarkers: exclude pseudohypernatremia, confirm glucose-corrected sodium concentrations, determine the extracellular volume status, measure urine sodium levels, measure urine volume and osmolality, check ongoing urinary electrolyte free water clearance, determine arginine vasopressin/copeptin levels, and assess other electrolyte disorders. Moreover, we suggest six steps to manage hypernatremia by replacing water deficits, ongoing water losses, and insensible water losses: identify underlying causes, distinguish between acute and chronic hypernatremia, determine the amount and rate of water administration, select the type of replacement solution, adjust the treatment schedule, and consider additional therapy for diabetes insipidus. Physicians may apply some of these steps to all patients with hypernatremia, and can also adapt the regimens for specific causes or situations...."
hyperparathyroidism,"We reviewed the etiology and management of secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) that is appropriate and in response to a stimulus, most commonly low serum calcium. In secondary hyperparathyroidism, the serum calcium is normal and the PTH level is elevated. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by excessive secretion of PTH after longstanding secondary hyperparathyroidism, in which hypercalcemia has ensued. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism typically occurs in men and women with chronic kidney disease usually after kidney transplant. The etiology and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism is relatively straightforward whereas data on the management of tertiary hyperparathyroidism is limited to a few small trials with short follow-up...."
hypersensitivity pneumonitis,"The clinical and pathologic diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis has been confounded by conflicting definitions, with two recent guidelines suggesting that hypersensitivity pneumonitis simply be diagnosed as nonfibrotic or fibrotic. Nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis is usually characterized by a bronchiolocentric chronic interstitial inflammatory infiltrate, frequently but by no means always with associated granulomas or giant cells. Fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis may take the form of interstitial fibrosis confined to the peribronchiolar regions, or fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, or a process similar to and sometimes indistinguishable from usual interstitial pneumonia/idiopathic interstitial fibrosis, but the exact pathologic features that favor a diagnosis of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis are disputed. Granulomas/giant cells are much less frequent in fibrotic compared to nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Extensive peribronchiolar metaplasia, particularly peribronchiolar metaplasia affecting more than half the bronchioles, supports a diagnosis of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis over usual interstitial pneumonia, as does the presence of predominantly peribronchiolar disease with relative subpleural sparing. Clinical and CT features are crucial to the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: sparing of the lung bases, centrilobular nodules, air-trapping, or the triple density sign with fibrosis favor a diagnosis of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. At this point there are no molecular tests that reliably separate fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis from other forms of interstitial lung disease. Currently the separation of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis from usual interstitial pneumonia is crucial to treatment (immunosuppressives for the former, anti-fibrotics for the latter) but this approach is changing and all progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonias will probably be treated with antifibrotics in the future...."
hypertensive heart disease,"Hypertension is possibly the most powerful, modifiable risk factor for the development of heart failure. Chronic hypertension drives cardiac remodeling within the left ventricle resulting in hypertensive heart disease, which ultimately manifests as heart failure. Early detection and appropriate management are necessary to prevent heart failure as well as other cardiovascular diseases. Achieving blood pressure goals in conjunction with using evidence-based treatments can improve clinical outcomes for patients with comorbid hypertension and heart failure...."
hypocalcemia,"The aim of this clinical narrative review is to summarize and critically appraise the literature on the differential diagnosis of hypocalcemia and to provide its correct management. Calcium is essential for muscle contraction and neurotransmitter release, but clinical manifestations of hypocalcaemia (serum calcium level <8 mg/dl; 2.12 mmol/L) may involve almost any organ and system and may range from asymptomatic to life-threating conditions. Disorders causing hypocalcemia can be divided into parathyroid hormone (PTH) and non-PTH mediated. The most frequent cause of hypocalcemia is postsurgical hypoparathyroidism, while a more comprehensive search for other causes is needed for appropriate treatment in the non PTH-mediated forms. Intravenous calcium infusion is essential to raise calcium levels and resolve or minimize symptoms in the setting of acute hypocalcemia. Oral calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation is the most frequently used as treatment of chronic hypocalcemia. In hypoparathyroidism, providing the missing hormone with the use of the recombinant human (rh) PTH(1-84) has been recently approved both by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This new therapy has the advantage of being effective for correcting serum calcium levels and significantly reducing the daily requirements of calcium and active vitamin D supplements. However, due to the high cost, a strict selection of candidates to this therapy is necessary. More challenging is the long-term hypocalcemia treatment, due to its associated complications. The development of long-acting recombinant human PTH will probably modify the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism in the future...."
hyponatremia,"Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field...."
infection of open wound,"Background: Open fractures, defined as fractures communicating with the environment through a skin wound, cause substantial morbidity after traumatic injury. Current evidence supports administration of prophylactic systemic antibiotic agents to patients with open extremity fractures to decrease infectious complications. Methods: The Therapeutic and Guidelines Committee of The Surgical Infection Society convened to revise guidelines for antibiotic use in open fractures. PubMed was queried for pertinent studies. Evaluation of the published evidence was performed using the GRADE framework. All committee members voted to accept or reject each recommendation. Results: In type I or II open extremity fractures, we recommend against administration of extended-spectrum antibiotic coverage compared with gram-positive coverage alone to decrease infections complications, hospital length of stay or mortality. In type III open extremity fractures, we recommend antibiotic therapy for no more than 24 hrs after injury, in the absence of clinical signs of active infection, to decrease infectious complications, hospital length of stay or mortality, and we recommend against extended antimicrobial coverage beyond gram-positive organisms to decrease infectious complications, hospital length of stay or mortality. In type III open extremity fractures with associated bone loss, we recommend antibiotic therapy in addition to systemic therapy to decrease infectious complications. Conclusions: Although antibiotic agents remain a standard of care for infection prevention after open extremity fractures, our findings and surveys of clinical practice patterns clearly show that additional robust clinical trials are needed to provide stronger corroborating evidence...."
infectious gastroenteritis,"Despite the introduction of vaccination against rotavirus, and even though it can often be treated on an outpatient basis, acute infectious gastroenteritis is nevertheless the second most common non-traumatic cause of emergency hospitaliza - tion in children aged 1 to 5 years, accounting for approximately 9% of cases (39 410 cases in 2017). The most common path - ogens are viruses (47% rotavirus, 29% norovirus, and 14% adenovirus)...."
inguinal hernia,"Inguinal hernia is the most frequently diagnosed hernia and during their lifetime one third of males are diagnosed with an inguinal hernia. The age distribution is bimodal with the highest incidence in childhood and after 50 years of age. Diagnosis is usually reached through clinical examination of a lump in the inguinal region although some patients can present with intestinal obstruction. Inguinal hernia repair is the only definitive treatment and is one of the most common surgical procedures performed. It is usually performed as an elective procedure in local, spinal or general anasthesia. The repair constitutes of reinforcing the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, often using a polypropylene mesh; either via an open anterior approach or posteriorly from within the abdomen with laparoscopy. The most common complications following a hernia repair are recurrent hernia and chronic -discomfort but recurrence rates have improved with the use of mesh and laparoscopic techniques. This evidence based review describes the -epidemiology and etiology of inguinal hernia together with the most common surgical procedures; focusing on recent innovations...."
injury of the ankle,"The management protocol for each case of ankle sprain should be individualized and optimized in order to reduce the likelihood of development of chronic instability. Initial treatment aims to address pain, swelling, and inflammation and facilitates regaining pain-free joint motion. Short-term joint immobilization is indicated in severe cases. Subsequently, muscle strengthening, balance training, and targeted activities to develop proprioception are added. Gradually, sports-related activities are added with the ultimate goal of bringing the individual back to preinjury level of activity. This protocol of conservative treatment should always be offered before considering any surgical intervention...."
insomnia,"Insomnia-the unwelcome experience of difficulty sleeping-is common and can be acute, intermittent, or chronic. Insomnia can be the presenting symptom for several common sleep disorders, but it also often occurs comorbidly with mental and physical health conditions. Evaluating the symptom of insomnia requires assessing-largely by history-whether an underlying condition explains it. Insomnia disorder is the diagnostic term for the symptom of insomnia that merits specific attention. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the preferred treatment approach because of its efficacy, safety, and durability of benefit, but pharmaceutical treatments are widely used for insomnia symptoms...."
intracranial abscess,These European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guidelines are intended for clinicians involved in diagnosis and treatment of brain abscess in children and adults....
iridocyclitis,"Posner-Schlossman syndrome, or glaucomatocyclitic crisis, is a unilateral ocular condition characterized by recurrent attacks of nongranulomatous anterior uveitis and raised intraocular pressure that can result in chronic secondary glaucoma. This relatively rare disease is most likely the result of recurrent cytomegalovirus infection and affects predominantly middle-aged males. Diagnosis is largely clinical, with aqueous and blood sampling aiding the identification of any underlying infectious cause. Successful disease management is often achieved by topical treatment, although systemic therapy and even surgical intervention may be required. We discuss our current understanding of Posner-Schlossman syndrome, from its pathophysiology through to recommended treatment options...."
irritable bowel syndrome,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disease with a significant impact on patients' quality of life and a high socioeconomic burden. And the understanding of IBS has changed since the release of the Rome IV diagnosis in 2016. With the upcoming Rome V revision, it is necessary to review the results of IBS research in recent years. In this review of IBS, we can highlight future concerns by reviewing the results of IBS research on epidemiology, overlap disorders, pathophysiology, and treatment over the past decade and summarizing the latest research...."
itching of unknown cause,"Itch pathogenesis is broadly characterized into histaminergic and nonhistaminergic pathways and transmitted via 2 main receptor families: G protein-coupled receptors and transient receptor potential channels. In the skin, itch is primarily transmitted by unmyelinated type C and thinly myelinated type Aδ nerve fibers. Crosstalk between the immune and neural systems modulates itch transmission at the skin, spinal cord, and brain. Among the many known pruritogens, Th2 cytokines, such as interleukin-4, interleukin-13, interleukin-31, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, are particularly important mediators that signal through shared Janus kinase pathways, representing novel targets for novel itch therapeutics. Emerging evidence has also revealed that the opioidergic system is a potent modulator of itch transmission, with increased μ-opioid activity and decreased κ-opioid activity contributing to itch pathogenesis. Optimal management of itch requires that treatment approaches be tailored to specific etiologic itch subtypes. When the etiology is unknown and patients are given a diagnosis of chronic pruritus of unknown origin, treatment should be guided by the presence of Th2 polarization, often reflected by increased blood eosinophils. In the second article of this 2-part series, we outline our current understanding of itch pathogenesis and discuss available and emerging treatments for itch...."
kidney cancer,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of urogenital cancer. It has a mortality rate of 30-40% and is more commonly seen in men than women. In addition to gender, other risk factors of RCC include obesity, hypertension, smoking, and chronic kidney disease. Following the improvements in diagnostic tests, such as CT and MRI imaging, the incidence of patients diagnosed with RCC has rapidly increased over the past decades. The most common type of RCC, based on histological and molecular subtypes, is clear cell carcinoma which occurs frequently due to mutations in the VHL gene. Nephron-sparing surgery is a selective technique to maintain kidneys in patients while radical nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy are used to remove small tumors. In addition to surgical approaches, adjuvant therapy and targeted therapy are applied in patients with metastatic RCC. In this review, we give an overview of the most recent research on RCC which would help physicians to better manage patients with RCC...."
kidney failure,"Chronic kidney disease is highly prevalent (10-13% of the population), irreversible, progressive, and associated with higher cardiovascular risk. Patients with this pathology remain asymptomatic most of the time, presenting the complications typical of renal dysfunction only in more advanced stages. Its treatment can be conservative (patients without indication for dialysis, usually those with glomerular filtration rate above 15 ml/minute) or replacement therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation). The objectives of the conservative treatment for chronic kidney disease are to slow down the progression of kidney dysfunction, treat complications (anemia, bone diseases, cardiovascular diseases), vaccination for hepatitis B, and preparation for kidney replacement therapy...."
kidney stone,"The prevalence of kidney stone disease is increasing worldwide. The recurrence rate of urinary stones is estimated to be up to 50%. Nephrolithiasis is associated with increased risk of chronic and end stage kidney disease. Diet composition is considered to play a crucial role in urinary stone formation. There is strong evidence that an inadequate fluid intake is the major dietary risk factor for urolithiasis. While the benefit of high fluid intake has been confirmed, the effect of different beverages, such as tap water, mineral water, fruit juices, soft drinks, tea and coffee, are debated. Other nutritional factors, including dietary protein, carbohydrates, oxalate, calcium and sodium chloride can also modulate the urinary risk profile and contribute to the risk of kidney stone formation. The assessment of nutritional risk factors is an essential component in the specific dietary therapy of kidney stone patients. An appropriate dietary intervention can contribute to the effective prevention of recurrent stones and reduce the burden of invasive surgical procedures for the treatment of urinary stone disease. This narrative review has intended to provide a comprehensive and updated overview on the role of nutrition and diet in kidney stone disease...."
kidney stones,"Kidney stones are mineral deposits in the renal calyces and pelvis that are found free or attached to the renal papillae. They contain crystalline and organic components and are formed when the urine becomes supersaturated with respect to a mineral. Calcium oxalate is the main constituent of most stones, many of which form on a foundation of calcium phosphate called Randall's plaques, which are present on the renal papillary surface. Stone formation is highly prevalent, with rates of up to 14.8% and increasing, and a recurrence rate of up to 50% within the first 5 years of the initial stone episode. Obesity, diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome are considered risk factors for stone formation, which, in turn, can lead to hypertension, chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Management of symptomatic kidney stones has evolved from open surgical lithotomy to minimally invasive endourological treatments leading to a reduction in patient morbidity, improved stone-free rates and better quality of life. Prevention of recurrence requires behavioural and nutritional interventions, as well as pharmacological treatments that are specific for the type of stone. There is a great need for recurrence prevention that requires a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in stone formation to facilitate the development of more-effective drugs...."
kwashiorkor,"Protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is a common problem worldwide and occurs in both developing and industrialized nations. In the developing world, it is frequently a result of socioeconomic, political, or environmental factors. In contrast, protein energy malnutrition in the developed world usually occurs in the context of chronic disease. There remains much variation in the criteria used to define malnutrition, with each method having its own limitations. Early recognition, prompt management, and robust follow up are critical for best outcomes in preventing and treating PEM...."
labyrinthitis,"Labyrinthitis most commonly results from an infectious and less commonly from an inflammatory process of the inner ear, but it can be associated with temporal bone trauma, hemorrhage, or tumor. This inflammation (regardless of the etiology) disrupts the transmission of sensory information from the ear to the brain. Labyrinthitis ossificans is the pathological ossification of the membranous labyrinthine spaces in response to an insult to the inner ear involving membranous labyrinth or the endosteum of the otic capsule. Herein, we present a case of a 67-year-old female with progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and positional vertigo...."
leishmaniasis,"Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne infectious disease caused by multiple Leishmania (L.) species with diverse clinical manifestations. There is currently no vaccine against any form of the disease approved in humans, and chemotherapy is the sole approach for treatment. Unfortunately, treatment options are limited to a small number of drugs, partly due to high cost and significant adverse effects. The other obstacle in leishmaniasis treatment is the potential for drug resistance, which has been observed in multiple endemic countries. Immunotherapy maybe another important avenue for controlling leishmaniasis and could help patients control the disease. There are different approaches for immunotherapy in different infectious diseases, generally with low-cost, limited side-effects and no possibility to developing resistance. In this paper, different immunotherapy approaches as alternatives to routine drug treatment will be reviewed against leishmaniasis...."
leprosy,"Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a curable infectious disease that remains endemic in >140 countries around the world. Despite being declared ""eliminated"" as a global public health problem by the World Health Organization in the year 2000, approximately 200,000 new cases were reported worldwide in 2017. Widespread migration may bring leprosy to nonendemic areas, such as North America. In addition, there are areas in the United States where autochthonous (person-to-person) transmission of leprosy is being reported among Americans without a history of foreign exposure. In the first article in this continuing medical education series, we review leprosy epidemiology, transmission, classification, clinical features, and diagnostic challenges...."
leukemia,"Leukemias are a group of life threatening malignant disorders of the blood and bone marrow. In the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population, the acute leukemias are most prevalent, with chronic myeloid leukemia being infrequently seen. Factors associated with more aggressive disease biology tend to increase in frequency with increasing age, whilst tolerability of treatment strategies decreases. There are also challenges regarding the effective delivery of therapy specific to the AYA group, consequences on the unique psychosocial needs of this age group, including compliance. This chapter reviews the current status of epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment strategies and outcomes of AYA leukemia, with a focus on acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia...."
lice,"Human lice have always been a major public health concern due to their vector capacity for louse-borne infectious diseases, like trench fever, louse-borne relapsing fever, and epidemic fever, which are caused by Bartonella quintana, Borrelia recurrentis, and Rickettsia prowazekii, respectively. Those diseases are currently re-emerging in the regions of poor hygiene, social poverty, or wars with life-threatening consequences. These louse-borne diseases have also caused outbreaks among populations in jails and refugee camps. In addition, antibodies and DNAs to those pathogens have been steadily detected in homeless populations. Importantly, more bacterial pathogens have been detected in human lice, and some have been transmitted by human lice in laboratories. Here, we provide a comprehensive review and update on louse-borne infectious diseases/bacterial pathogens...."
lichen simplex,"Lichen simplex chronicus is a form of chronic localized pruritus with a secondary dermatitis, and one of the most common types of chronic itch conditions, estimated to affect more than 10% of the general population. However, despite its prevalence and burden, there has been limited research into the pathogenesis and aetiology of lichen simplex chronicus, which, historically, made it a challenging condition to treat. In recent years, our understanding of this condition, along with that of pruritus and the itch-scratch cycle, has increased greatly, enabling a substantial increase in treatment options. In addition, there are several new promising treatments currently in development and trials. This article discusses the definition, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and current therapeutic options for lichen simplex chronicus, in order to highlight recent advancements in this field...."
low blood potassium,"Potassium is an essential nutrient that performs a vital role in cellular functions including maintaining fluid balance and osmolality of cells. Potassium balance is maintained by the kidney and the majority of ingested potassium is excreted in the urine. There is strong evidence of a negative association between dietary potassium and blood pressure, and some evidence (much of it indirect) of negative associations between dietary potassium and cardiovascular disease (particularly stroke and coronary heart disease) and kidney disease (chronic renal failure, and kidney stones). Blood pressure lowering is particularly associated with high potassium and low sodium diets. Important dietary sources of potassium include fruit and vegetables (including rice, potatoes, legumes and wholegrains), dairy products, and animal proteins. Worldwide, diets are low in potassium compared to dietary guidelines. Interventions focused on increasing dietary potassium will have major benefits including improvements in diet, reducing non-communicable disease and enhancing planetary health...."
lumbago,"Low back pain is usually nonspecific or mechanical. Mechanical low back pain arises intrinsically from the spine, intervertebral disks, or surrounding soft tissues. Clinical clues, or red flags, may help identify cases of nonmechanical low back pain and prompt further evaluation or imaging. Red flags include progressive motor or sensory loss, new urinary retention or overflow incontinence, history of cancer, recent invasive spinal procedure, and significant trauma relative to age. Imaging on initial presentation should be reserved for when there is suspicion for cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. Plain radiography of the lumbar spine is appropriate to assess for fracture and bony abnormality, whereas magnetic resonance imaging is better for identifying the source of neurologic or soft tissue abnormalities. There are multiple treatment modalities for mechanical low back pain, but strong evidence of benefit is often lacking. Moderate evidence supports the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and topiramate in the short-term treatment of mechanical low back pain. There is little or no evidence of benefit for acetaminophen, antidepressants (except duloxetine), skeletal muscle relaxants, lidocaine patches, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in the treatment of chronic low back pain. There is strong evidence for short-term effectiveness and moderate-quality evidence for long-term effectiveness of yoga in the treatment of chronic low back pain. Various spinal manipulative techniques (osteopathic manipulative treatment, spinal manipulative therapy) have shown mixed benefits in the acute and chronic setting. Physical therapy modalities such as the McKenzie method may decrease the recurrence of low back pain and health care expenditures. Physical therapy modalities such as the McKenzie method may decrease the recurrence of low back pain and use of health care. Educating patients on prognosis and incorporating psychosocial components of care such as identifying comorbid psychological problems and barriers to treatment are essential components of long-term management...."
lung cancer,"Despite advances in our understanding of risk, development, immunologic control, and treatment options for lung cancer, it remains the leading cause of cancer death. Tobacco smoking remains the predominant risk factor for lung cancer development. Nontobacco risk factors include environmental and occupational exposures, chronic lung disease, lung infections, and lifestyle factors. Because tobacco remains the leading risk factor for lung cancer, disease prevention is focused on smoking avoidance and cessation. Other prevention measures include healthy diet choices and maintaining a physically active lifestyle. Future work should focus on smoking cessation campaigns and better understanding disease development and treatment strategies in nonsmokers...."
lupus nephritis,"SLE is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the kidneys in about 50% of patients. Lupus nephritis is a major risk factor for overall morbidity and mortality in SLE, and despite potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies still ends in CKD or ESRD for too many patients. This review highlights recent updates in our understanding of disease epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, and treatment in an effort to establish a framework for lupus nephritis management that is patient-specific and oriented toward maintaining long-term kidney function in patients with lupus...."
lymphangitis,"To describe the clinical and pathological features of canine focal lipogranulomatous lymphangitis, to evaluate its underlying infectious cause and to compare it with human Crohn's disease...."
lymphedema,"Lymphedema is a localized form of tissue swelling resulting from excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment and caused by impaired lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema is classified as primary or secondary. Primary lymphedema is caused by developmental lymphatic vascular anomalies. Secondary lymphedema is acquired and arises as a result of an underlying systemic disease, trauma, or surgery. We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (1966-2017) using the terms lymphedema, cancer-related lymphedema, and lymphatic complications. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. This progressive chronic disease has serious implications on patients' quality of life. It is often misdiagnosed because it mimics other conditions of extremity swelling. There is no definitive cure for lymphedema. However, with proper diagnosis and management, its progression and potential complications may be limited...."
malaria,"Malaria has had a greater impact on world history than any other infectious disease. More than 300 to 500 million individuals worldwide are infected with Plasmodium spp, and 1.5 to 2.7 million people a year, most of whom are children, die from the infection. Malaria is endemic in over 90 countries in which 2400 million people live; this represents 40% of the world's population. Approximately 90% of malaria deaths occur in Africa. Despite continuing efforts in vaccine development, malaria prevention is difficult, and no drug is universally effective. This article examines malaria caused by the 4 most common Plasmodium spp that infect humans, P vivax, P ovale, P malariae, and P falciparum, as well as mixed infections and the simian parasite P knowlesi. A comprehensive review of the microbiology, clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of these forms of malaria is given...."
malignant otitis externa,"Malignant otitis externa is a progressive infection of the external auditory canal and skull base. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most isolated microorganism and it affects mostly to diabetic, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Non-resolving otalgia and chronic otorrhea are the clinical manifestations presented. Facial nerve palsy is a common and well recognized complication. (Computed tomography) CT scan is useful for initial assessment, Technetium-99m is highly sensitive and is part of the protocol for diagnosis. Treatment should be individualized, with multidisciplinary cooperation among specialties. Management involves systemic antipseudomonal antibiotics and monitoring with radiologic techniques, it also involves the strict control of diabetes. It is essential to follow up the patients for at least a year post-treatment. In refractory malignant otitis externa and affection of facial nerve, surgical management is recommended. We reviewed the most recent studies on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment to provide an update on Malignant Otitis Externa that can offer an overview for clinical practice and future research...."
mediastinitis,"Acute mediastinitis is a rare infection that carries high morbidity and mortality. They are complications seen most often with deep sternal wound infections from surgeries with median sternotomies, oropharyngeal and odontogenic infections and esophageal perforations. These conditions should be promptly recognized and treated. Mediastinal granulomas are focal, mass-like lesions commonly resulting from prior granulomatous infections. They are regarded as benign, self-resolving lesions however can cause complications by compression of adjacent mediastinal structures. Chronic fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare, diffuse fibroinflammatory process most often seen with granulomatous infections and carries a worse prognosis than mediastinal granulomas especially when adjacent mediastinal structures are compromised. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, etiology, clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis of acute mediastinitis, mediastinal granulomas, and chronic fibrosing mediastinitis...."
meningitis,"Meningitis is defined as inflammation of the meninges, in almost all cases identified by an abnormal number of white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid and specific clinical signs/symptoms. Onset may be acute or chronic, and clinical symptoms of acute disease develop over hours to days. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of acute meningitis, and provides a list of key points for primary care practitioners. Aseptic and bacterial meningitis vary significantly and are discussed separately...."
migraine,Migraine continues second among the world's causes of disability. Diagnosis is based on the history and clinical examination and imaging is usually not necessary. Migraine can be subdivided depending on whether there is an aura or not and based on the frequency of the headaches. The number of headache days determines whether the patient has episodic migraine or chronic migraine. Treating migraines can be done to treatment the migraine itself and to prevent its appearance. In this review we approach the migraine from a practical point of view with updated information....
mononucleosis,"Infectious mononucleosis is a viral syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. It is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus and most often affects adolescents and young adults 15 to 24 years of age. Primary transmission is through close personal contact with a person who is infected, particularly their saliva. Cost-effective, efficient initial laboratory testing for acute infectious mononucleosis includes complete blood count with differential (to assess for greater than 40% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes) and a rapid heterophile antibody test. The heterophile antibody test has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 91% but can have a false-negative result in children younger than five years and in adults during the first week of illness. The presence of elevated liver enzymes increases clinical suspicion for infectious mononucleosis in the setting of a negative heterophile antibody test result. Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen-antibody testing is more sensitive and specific but more expensive and takes longer to process than the rapid heterophile antibody test. Treatment of infectious mononucleosis is supportive; routine use of antivirals and corticosteroids is not recommended. Current guidelines recommend that patients with infectious mononucleosis not participate in athletic activity for three weeks from onset of symptoms. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the timing of return to activity. Immunosuppressed populations are at higher risk of severe disease and significant morbidity. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been linked to nine types of cancer, including Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some autoimmune diseases...."
mumps,"Mumps is an important childhood infectious disease caused by mumps virus (MuV). We reviewed the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and vaccine development of mumps. Previous studies were identified using the key words ""mumps"" and ""epidemiology"", ""pathogenesis"" or ""vaccine"" in MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We excluded the articles that were not published in the English language, manuscripts without abstracts, and opinion articles from the review. The number of cases caused by MuV decreased steeply after the introduction of the mumps vaccine worldwide. In recent years, a global resurgence of mumps cases in developed countries and cases of aseptic meningitis caused by some mumps vaccine strains have renewed the importance of MuV infection worldwide. The performance of mumps vaccination has become an important issue for controlling mumps infections. Vaccine development and routine vaccination are still effective measures to globally reduce the incidence of mumps infections. During outbreaks, a third of MMR vaccine is recommended for groups of persons determined by public authorities...."
myocarditis,"Myocarditis may present with a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild dyspnea or chest pain that resolves without specific therapy to cardiogenic shock and death. Dilated cardiomyopathy with chronic heart failure is the major long-term sequela of myocarditis. Most often, myocarditis results from common viral infections; less commonly, specific forms of myocarditis may result from other pathogens, toxic or hypersensitivity drug reactions, giant-cell myocarditis, or sarcoidosis. The prognosis and treatment of myocarditis vary according to the cause, and clinical and hemodynamic data usually provide guidance to decide when to refer a patient to a specialist for endomyocardial biopsy. The aim of this review is to provide a practical and current approach to the evaluation and treatment of suspected myocarditis...."
nasal polyp,"Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is an important clinical entity diagnosed by the presence of both subjective and objective evidence of chronic sinonasal inflammation. Symptoms include anterior or posterior rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hyposmia, and/or facial pressure or pain that last for a duration of more than 12 weeks. Nasal polyps are inflammatory lesions that project into the nasal airway, are typically bilateral, and originate from the ethmoid sinus. Males are more likely to be affected than females, but no specific genetic or environmental factors have been strongly linked to the development of this disorder to date. CRSwNP is frequently associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the clinical symptoms are not fully understood. Defects in the sinonasal epithelial cell barrier, increased exposure to pathogenic and colonized bacteria, and dysregulation of the host immune system are all thought to play prominent roles in disease pathogenesis. Additional studies are needed to further explore the clinical and pathophysiological features of CRSwNP so that biomarkers can be identified and novel advances can be made to improve the treatment and management of this disease...."
neuralgia,"Neuropathic pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system is a common chronic pain condition with major impact on quality of life. Examples include trigeminal neuralgia, painful polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and central poststroke pain. Most patients complain of an ongoing or intermittent spontaneous pain of, for example, burning, pricking, squeezing quality, which may be accompanied by evoked pain, particular to light touch and cold. Ectopic activity in, for example, nerve-end neuroma, compressed nerves or nerve roots, dorsal root ganglia, and the thalamus may in different conditions underlie the spontaneous pain. Evoked pain may spread to neighboring areas, and the underlying pathophysiology involves peripheral and central sensitization. Maladaptive structural changes and a number of cell-cell interactions and molecular signaling underlie the sensitization of nociceptive pathways. These include alteration in ion channels, activation of immune cells, glial-derived mediators, and epigenetic regulation. The major classes of therapeutics include drugs acting on α2δ subunits of calcium channels, sodium channels, and descending modulatory inhibitory pathways...."
noninfectious gastroenteritis,"Probiotics have been considered as an economical and safe alternative for the treatment of a large number of chronic diseases and improvement of human health. They are known to modulate the host immunity and protect from several infectious and non-infectious diseases. The colonization, killing of pathogens and induction of host cells are few of the important probiotic attributes which affect several functions of the host. In addition, prebiotics and non-digestible food substances selectively promote the growth of probiotics and human health through nutrient enrichment, and modulation of gut microbiota and immune system. This review highlights the role of probiotics and prebiotics alone and in combination (synbiotics) in the modulation of immune system, treatment of infections, management of inflammatory bowel disease and cancer therapy. KEY POINTS: • Probiotics and their derivatives against several human diseases. • Prebiotics feed probiotics and induce several functions in the host. • Discovery of novel and biosafe products needs attention for human health...."
nose disorder,"Nasal disease in dogs is common and is often accompanied by chronic nasal discharge with or without other clinical signs. A thorough history and physical examination often guide the most appropriate choice of diagnostic testing to provide the best chance of attaining a diagnosis as to cause, and therefore, the most appropriate treatment. The purpose of this article is to guide the practitioner through a logical approach to the evaluation of dogs that are presented with signs of nasal disease...."
obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd),"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by time-consuming, distressing, or impairing obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are recurrent, persistent, and intrusive thoughts, urges, or images. Compulsions are repetitive and often ritualized behaviors or mental acts performed to manage obsession-related distress or prevent harm. OCD affects 1% to 3% of the population, typically begins during adolescence or early adulthood, and can have a chronic or deteriorating course in the absence of effective treatment...."
onychomycosis,"Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail, causing discoloration and thickening of the affected nail plate, and is the most common nail infection worldwide. Onychomycosis was initially thought to be predominantly caused by dermatophytes; however, new research has revealed that mixed infections and those caused by non-dermatophyte moulds (NDMs) are more prevalent than previously thought, especially in warmer climates. Microscopy and fungal culture are the gold standard techniques for onychomycosis diagnosis, but high false-negative rates have pushed for more accurate methods, such as histology and PCR. As NDMs are skin and laboratory contaminants, their presence as an infectious agent requires multiple confirmations and repeated sampling. There are several treatment options available, including oral antifungals, topicals and devices. Oral antifungals have higher cure rates and shorter treatment periods than topical treatments, but have adverse side effects such as hepatotoxicity and drug interactions. Terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole are most commonly used, with new oral antifungals such as fosravuconazole being evaluated. Topical treatments, such as efinaconazole, tavaborole, ciclopirox and amorolfine have less serious side effects, but also have generally lower cure rates and much longer treatment regimens. New topical formulations are being investigated as faster-acting alternatives to the currently available topical treatments. Devices such as lasers have shown promise in improving the cosmetic appearance of the nail, but due to a high variation of study methods and definitions of cure, their effectiveness for onychomycosis has yet to be sufficiently proven. Recurrence rates for onychomycosis are high; once infected, patients should seek medical treatment as soon as possible and sanitize their shoes and socks. Prophylactic application of topicals and avoiding walking barefoot in public places may help prevent recurrence...."
open wound due to trauma,"Wound healing is a complex, dynamic process supported by a myriad of cellular events that must be tightly coordinated to efficiently repair damaged tissue. Derangement in wound-linked cellular behaviours, as occurs with diabetes and ageing, can lead to healing impairment and the formation of chronic, non-healing wounds. These wounds are a significant socioeconomic burden due to their high prevalence and recurrence. Thus, there is an urgent requirement for the improved biological and clinical understanding of the mechanisms that underpin wound repair. Here, we review the cellular basis of tissue repair and discuss how current and emerging understanding of wound pathology could inform future development of efficacious wound therapies...."
open wound of the arm,"Cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to permanent impairment of arm and hand functions. Here we conducted a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, open-label, non-significant risk trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of ARCEX Therapy to improve arm and hand functions in people with chronic SCI. ARCEX Therapy involves the delivery of externally applied electrical stimulation over the cervical spinal cord during structured rehabilitation. The primary endpoints were safety and efficacy as measured by whether the majority of participants exhibited significant improvement in both strength and functional performance in response to ARCEX Therapy compared to the end of an equivalent period of rehabilitation alone. Sixty participants completed the protocol. No serious adverse events related to ARCEX Therapy were reported, and the primary effectiveness endpoint was met. Seventy-two percent of participants demonstrated improvements greater than the minimally important difference criteria for both strength and functional domains. Secondary endpoint analysis revealed significant improvements in fingertip pinch force, hand prehension and strength, upper extremity motor and sensory abilities and self-reported increases in quality of life. These results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of ARCEX Therapy to improve hand and arm functions in people living with cervical SCI. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04697472 ...."
optic neuritis,"This article discusses the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of the patient with optic neuritis. Initial emphasis is placed on clinical history, examination, diagnostic testing, and medical decision making, while subsequent focus is placed on examining specific inflammatory optic neuropathies. Clinical clues, examination findings, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing that differentiate autoimmune, granulomatous, demyelinating, infectious, and paraneoplastic causes of optic neuritis are assessed, and current treatments are evaluated...."
oral mucosal lesion,"Oral cancer (OC) is an uncommon malignancy in Western countries, being one of the most common cancers in some high-risk areas of the world. It is a largely preventable cancer, since most of the different risk factors identified, such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and betel nut chewing, are behaviors that increase the likelihood of the disease. Given its high mortality, early diagnosis is of utmost importance. Prevention and the anticipation of diagnosis begin with identification of potentially malignant lesions of the oral mucosa and with local conditions promoting chronic inflammation. Therefore, every lesion must be recognized promptly and treated adequately. The clinical recognition and evaluation of oral mucosal lesions can detect up to 99% of oral cancers/premalignancies. As stated by the World Health Organization, any suspicious lesion that does not subside within two weeks from detection and removal of local causes of irritation must be biopsied. Surgical biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of oral cancer. Adjunctive tools have been developed and studied to help clinicians in the diagnostic pathway, such as toluidine blue vital staining and autofluorescence imaging. In the near future other methods, i.e., identification of salivary markers of progression may help in reducing mortality due to oral cancer...."
osteomyelitis,"Bone and joint infections are painful for patients and frustrating for both them and their doctors. The high success rates of antimicrobial therapy in most infectious diseases have not yet been achieved in bone and joint infections owing to the physiological and anatomical characteristics of bone. The key to successful management is early diagnosis, including bone sampling for microbiological and pathological examination to allow targeted and long-lasting antimicrobial therapy. The various types of osteomyelitis require differing medical and surgical therapeutic strategies. These types include, in order of decreasing frequency: osteomyelitis secondary to a contiguous focus of infection (after trauma, surgery, or insertion of a joint prosthesis); that secondary to vascular insufficiency (in diabetic foot infections); or that of haematogenous origin. Chronic osteomyelitis is associated with avascular necrosis of bone and formation of sequestrum (dead bone), and surgical debridement is necessary for cure in addition to antibiotic therapy. By contrast, acute osteomyelitis can respond to antibiotics alone. Generally, a multidisciplinary approach is required for success, involving expertise in orthopaedic surgery, infectious diseases, and plastic surgery, as well as vascular surgery, particularly for complex cases with soft-tissue loss...."
overflow incontinence,"Low back pain is usually nonspecific or mechanical. Mechanical low back pain arises intrinsically from the spine, intervertebral disks, or surrounding soft tissues. Clinical clues, or red flags, may help identify cases of nonmechanical low back pain and prompt further evaluation or imaging. Red flags include progressive motor or sensory loss, new urinary retention or overflow incontinence, history of cancer, recent invasive spinal procedure, and significant trauma relative to age. Imaging on initial presentation should be reserved for when there is suspicion for cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. Plain radiography of the lumbar spine is appropriate to assess for fracture and bony abnormality, whereas magnetic resonance imaging is better for identifying the source of neurologic or soft tissue abnormalities. There are multiple treatment modalities for mechanical low back pain, but strong evidence of benefit is often lacking. Moderate evidence supports the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and topiramate in the short-term treatment of mechanical low back pain. There is little or no evidence of benefit for acetaminophen, antidepressants (except duloxetine), skeletal muscle relaxants, lidocaine patches, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in the treatment of chronic low back pain. There is strong evidence for short-term effectiveness and moderate-quality evidence for long-term effectiveness of yoga in the treatment of chronic low back pain. Various spinal manipulative techniques (osteopathic manipulative treatment, spinal manipulative therapy) have shown mixed benefits in the acute and chronic setting. Physical therapy modalities such as the McKenzie method may decrease the recurrence of low back pain and health care expenditures. Physical therapy modalities such as the McKenzie method may decrease the recurrence of low back pain and use of health care. Educating patients on prognosis and incorporating psychosocial components of care such as identifying comorbid psychological problems and barriers to treatment are essential components of long-term management...."
paronychia,"Paronychia is inflammation of the fingers or toes in one or more of the three nail folds. Acute paronychia is caused by polymicrobial infections after the protective nail barrier has been breached. Treatment consists of warm soaks with or without Burow solution or 1% acetic acid. Topical antibiotics should be used with or without topical steroids when simple soaks do not relieve the inflammation. The presence of an abscess should be determined, which mandates drainage. There are a variety of options for drainage, ranging from instrumentation with a hypodermic needle to a wide incision with a scalpel. Oral antibiotics are usually not needed if adequate drainage is achieved unless the patient is immunocompromised or a severe infection is present. Therapy is based on the most likely pathogens and local resistance patterns. Chronic paronychia is characterized by symptoms of at least six weeks' duration and represents an irritant dermatitis to the breached nail barrier. Common irritants include acids, alkalis, and other chemicals used by housekeepers, dishwashers, bartenders, florists, bakers, and swimmers. Treatment is aimed at stopping the source of irritation while treating the inflammation with topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. More aggressive techniques may be required to restore the protective nail barrier. Treatment may take weeks to months. Patient education is paramount to reduce the recurrence of acute and chronic paronychia...."
pelvic inflammatory disease,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract occurring predominantly in sexually active young women. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes; however, other cervical, enteric, bacterial vaginosis-associated, and respiratory pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may be involved. PID can be acute, chronic, or subclinical and is often underdiagnosed. Untreated PID can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and intra-abdominal infections. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical suspicion, and empiric treatment is recommended in sexually active young women or women at risk for sexually transmitted infections who have unexplained lower abdominal or pelvic pain and cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on examination. Mild to moderate disease can be treated in an outpatient setting with a single intramuscular injection of a recommended cephalosporin followed by oral doxycycline for 14 days. Additionally, metronidazole is recommended for 14 days in the setting of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or recent uterine instrumentation. Hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics is recommended in patients who are pregnant or severely ill, in whom outpatient treatment has failed, those with tubo-ovarian abscess, or if surgical emergencies cannot be excluded. Treatment does not change in patients with intrauterine devices or those with HIV. Sex partner treatment is recommended; expedited partner treatment is recommended where legal. Prevention of PID includes screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in all women younger than 25 years and those who are at risk or pregnant, plus intensive behavioral counseling for all adolescents and adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections...."
perirectal infection,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder of phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils) resulting from impaired killing of bacteria and fungi. CGD is characterized by severe recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and dysregulated inflammatory responses resulting in granuloma formation and other inflammatory disorders such as colitis. Infections typically involve the lung (pneumonia), lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), liver (abscess), bone (osteomyelitis), and skin (abscesses or cellulitis). Granulomas typically involve the genitourinary system (bladder) and gastrointestinal tract (often the pylorus initially, and later the esophagus, jejunum, ileum, cecum, rectum, and perirectal area). Some males with X-linked CGD have McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome as the result of a contiguous gene deletion. While CGD may present anytime from infancy to late adulthood, the vast majority of affected individuals are diagnosed before age five years. Use of antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy has greatly improved overall survival...."
pilonidal cyst,"Pilonidal disease is a frequent suppurative condition that occurs twice as often in men as in women, usually between the ages of 15 and 30. Pilonidal disease is located beneath the skin of the sacro-coccygeal region. It presents acutely as an abscess under tension while the chronic form gives rise to intermittent discharge from pilonidal sinus(es). Diagnosis is clinical and usually straightforward. In the large majority of cases, treatment is surgical but there is no consensus as to the 'ideal' technique. Acute abscess must be evacuated and an off-midline incision seems preferable. Excision is the standard definitive treatment but the choice of wide versus limited excision depends on the school of thought. The widespread practice in France is to leave the wound open, relying on postoperative healing by secondary intention. This technique has a low rate of recurrence but has the disadvantages of requiring local nursing care; the healing process is prolonged, usually associated with a temporary but prolonged cessation of activity. Primary wound closure techniques are less restrictive but their recurrence rate is probably higher. A direct midline suture is best after a small excision, but for a more extended wound, plastic reconstruction techniques are preferred; data in the literature favor asymmetric closure techniques such as those described by Karydakis and Bascom...."
pituitary disorder,"Empty sella is a pituitary disorder characterized by the herniation of the subarachnoid space within the sella turcica. This is often associated with a variable degree of flattening of the pituitary gland. Empty sella has to be distinguished in primary and secondary forms. Primary empty sella (PES) excludes any history of previous pituitary pathologies such as previous surgical, pharmacologic, or radiotherapy treatment of the sellar region. PES is considered an idiopathic disease and may be associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Secondary empty sella, however, may occur after the treatment of pituitary tumors through neurosurgery or drugs or radiotherapy, after spontaneous necrosis (ischemia or hemorrhage) of chiefly adenomas, after pituitary infectious processes, pituitary autoimmune diseases, or brain trauma. Empty sella, in the majority of cases, is only a neuroradiological finding, without any clinical implication. However, empty sella syndrome is defined in the presence of pituitary hormonal dysfunction (more frequently hypopituitarism) and/or neurological symptoms due to the possible coexisting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Empty sella syndrome represents a peculiar clinical entity, characterized by heterogeneity both in clinical manifestations and in hormonal alterations, sometimes reaching severe extremes. For a proper diagnosis, management, and follow-up of empty sella syndrome, a multidisciplinary approach with the integration of endocrine, neurological, and ophthalmological experts is strongly advocated...."
placental abruption,"Placental abruption is the premature separation of the placenta from its uterine attachment before the delivery of a fetus. The clinical manifestations of abruption typically include vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain with a wide variety of abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. Clinical challenges arise when pregnant people with this condition present with profound vaginal bleeding, necessitating urgent delivery, especially when there is a concern for maternal and fetal compromise and coagulopathy. Abruption occurs in 0.6% to 1.2% of all pregnancies, with nearly half of abruption occurring at term gestations. An exposition of abruption at near-term (defined as the late preterm period from 34 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks of gestation) and term (defined as ≥37 weeks of gestation) provides unique insights into its direct effects, as risks associated with preterm birth do not impact outcomes. Here, we explore the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and diagnosis of abruption. We discuss the interaction of chronic processes (decidual and uteroplacental vasculopathy) and acute processes (shearing forces applied to the abdomen) that underlie the pathophysiology. Risk factors for abruption and strengths of association are summarized. Sonographic findings of abruption and fetal heart rate tracings are presented. In addition, we propose a management algorithm for acute abruption that incorporates blood loss, vital signs, and urine output, among other factors. Lastly, we discuss blood component therapy, viscoelastic point-of-care testing, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and management of abruption complicated by fetal death. The review seeks to provide comprehensive, clinically focused guidance during a gestational age range when neonatal outcomes can often be favorable if rapid and evidence-based care is optimized...."
plantar fasciitis,"Plantar fasciitis, a chronic degenerative process that causes medial plantar heel pain, is responsible for approximately 1 million physician visits each year. Individuals with plantar fasciitis experience pain that is most intense during their first few steps of the day or after prolonged standing. The authors provide an overview of the diagnosis and management of a common problem encountered in the primary care setting. Routine imaging is not initially recommended for the evaluation of plantar fasciitis but may be required to rule out other pathologic conditions. Overall, plantar fasciitis carries a good prognosis when patients use a combination of several conservative treatment modalities. Occasionally, referral to a specialist may be necessary...."
pneumoconiosis,"Pneumoconiosis refers to a spectrum of pulmonary diseases caused by inhalation of mineral dust, usually as the result of certain occupations. The main pathological features include chronic pulmonary inflammation and progressive pulmonary fibrosis, which can eventually lead to death caused by respiratory and/or heart failure. Pneumoconiosis is widespread globally, seriously threatening global public health. Its high incidence and mortality lie in improper occupational protection, and in the lack of early diagnostic methods and effective treatments. This article reviews the epidemiology, safeguard procedures, diagnosis, and treatment of pneumoconiosis, and summarizes recent research advances and future research prospects...."
pneumothorax,"Pneumothorax is a common problem worldwide. Pneumothorax develops secondary to diverse aetiologies; in many cases, there may be no recognizable lung abnormality. The pathogenetic mechanism(s) causing spontaneous pneumothorax may be related to an interplay between lung-related abnormalities and environmental factors such as smoking. Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for primary spontaneous pneumothorax; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is most frequently associated with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. This review article provides an overview of the historical perspective, epidemiology, classification, and aetiology of pneumothorax. It also aims to highlight current knowledge and understanding of underlying risks and pathophysiological mechanisms in pneumothorax development...."
poisoning due to antidepressants,"Antidepressants are commonly prescribed and used in the management of depression, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric illnesses. Antidepressants used in therapeutic dosing ranges are associated with causing several adverse drug reactions including hepatotoxicity. Paroxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, mirtazapine and venlafaxine are associated with reversible liver injury upon discontinuation of the agent. Patient cases of hepatotoxicity involving the use of nefazodone, trazodone, duloxetine, bupropion, and sertraline are linked to causing death in its users. Due to the idiosyncratic nature of hepatotoxicity, monitoring of liver function tests and immediate discontinuation upon abnormal lab findings or signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction are crucial since most cases of hepatic damage are reversible when detected early. Onset of antidepressant-associated hepatotoxicity varies from 5 days to 3 years. Antidepressant-induced liver injury can occur in the absence of identifiable, underlying risk factors such as cirrhosis and hepatitis infection; only a few cases of hepatic injury involve patients with chronic hepatitis infection. Some of these cases involve possible drug interactions between antidepressants and concomitant agents that increase the risk for liver injury. Understanding druginduced liver injury associated with antidepressants and the importance of safety monitoring is essential to optimize outcomes for antidepressant treatment...."
poisoning due to antipsychotics,To review evidence for the treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and to discuss how to rechallenge patients with neuroleptics when continued pharmacotherapy for chronic psychological illness is required....
post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd),"Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (complex PTSD) is a severe mental disorder that emerges in response to traumatic life events. Complex PTSD is characterised by three core post-traumatic symptom clusters, along with chronic and pervasive disturbances in emotion regulation, identity, and relationships. Complex PTSD has been adopted as a new diagnosis in the ICD-11. Individuals with complex PTSD typically have sustained or multiple exposures to trauma, such as childhood abuse and domestic or community violence. The disorder has a 1-8% population prevalence and up to 50% prevalence in mental health facilities. Progress in diagnostics, assessment, and differentiation from post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder is reported, along with assessment and treatment of children and adolescents. Studies recommend multicomponent therapies starting with a focus on safety, psychoeducation, and patient-provider collaboration, and treatment components that include self-regulatory strategies and trauma-focused interventions...."
primary kidney disease,"Primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the exocrine (salivary and lachrymal) glands that results in sicca symptoms (dryness of the eyes and mouth). Systemic complications can occur in pSS, but renal involvement is rare, affecting <10% patients. The most frequent form of nephropathy in pSS is tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), in which infiltration of the kidney by plasma cells is a key feature and shows similarity to the lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the salivary glands. Electrolyte disturbances may occur in pSS, such as renal distal tubular acidosis, diabetes insipidus, Gitelman syndrome or Fanconi syndrome. Glomerular involvement is less frequently detected in patients with pSS, but usually takes the form of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis secondary to cryoglobulinaemia. The renal prognosis in patients with pSS and TIN or glomerular disease is usually favourable, but the risk of chronic kidney disease remains high in patients with TIN. Appropriate screening must be performed at least once a year in patients with systemic pSS in order to facilitate the early detection of renal complications. In this Review we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis and treatment of renal disease in pSS...."
psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a common, chronic papulosquamous skin disease occurring worldwide, presenting at any age, and leading to a substantial burden for individuals and society. It is associated with several important medical conditions, including depression, psoriatic arthritis, and cardiometabolic syndrome. Its most common form, chronic plaque or psoriasis vulgaris, is a consequence of genetic susceptibility, particularly in the presence of the HLA-C*06:02 risk allele, and of environmental triggers such as streptococcal infection, stress, smoking, obesity, and alcohol consumption. There are several phenotypes and research has separated pustular from chronic plaque forms. Immunological and genetic studies have identified IL-17 and IL-23 as key drivers of psoriasis pathogenesis. Immune targeting of these cytokines and of TNFα by biological therapies has revolutionised the care of severe chronic plaque disease. Psoriasis cannot currently be cured, but management should aim to minimise physical and psychological harm by treating patients early in the disease process, identifying and preventing associated multimorbidity, instilling lifestyle modifications, and employing a personalised approach to treatment...."
pulmonary hypertension,"Major advances in pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with lung disease, and chronic thromboembolic PH cast new light on the pathogenetic mechanisms, epidemiology, diagnostic approach, and therapeutic armamentarium for pulmonary vascular disease. Here, we summarize key basic, translational, and clinical PH reports, emphasizing findings that build on current state-of-the-art research. This review includes cutting-edge progress in translational pulmonary vascular biology, with a guide to the diagnosis of patients in clinical practice, incorporating recent PH definition revisions that continue emphasis on early detection of disease. PH management is reviewed including an overview of the evolving considerations for the approach to treatment of PH in patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities, as well as a discussion of the groundbreaking sotatercept data for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension...."
restless leg syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an uncomfortable urge to move the legs while at rest, relief upon movement or getting up to walk, and worsened symptom severity at night. RLS may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to pregnancy or a variety of systemic disorders, especially iron deficiency, and chronic renal insufficiency. Genetic predisposition with a family history is common. The pathogenesis of RLS remains unclear but is likely to involve central nervous system dopaminergic dysfunction, as well as other, undefined contributing mechanisms. Evaluation begins with a thorough history and examination, and iron measures, including ferritin and transferrin saturation, should be checked at presentation and with worsened symptoms, especially when augmentation develops. Augmentation is characterized by more intense symptom severity, earlier symptom occurrence, and often, symptom spread from the legs to the arms or other body regions. Some people with RLS have adequate symptom control with non-pharmacological measures such as massage or temperate baths. First-line management options include iron-replacement therapy in those with evidence for reduced body-iron stores or, alternatively, with prescribed gabapentin or pregabalin, and dopamine agonists such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine. Second-line therapies include intravenous iron infusion in those who are intolerant of oral iron and/or those having augmentation with intense, severe RLS symptoms, and opioids including tramadol, oxycodone, and methadone. RLS significantly impacts patients' quality of life and remains a therapeutic area sorely in need of innovation and a further pipeline of new, biologically informed therapies...."
rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint disease, which can cause cartilage and bone damage as well as disability. Early diagnosis is key to optimal therapeutic success, particularly in patients with well-characterised risk factors for poor outcomes such as high disease activity, presence of autoantibodies, and early joint damage. Treatment algorithms involve measuring disease activity with composite indices, applying a treatment-to-target strategy, and use of conventional, biological, and newz non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. After the treatment target of stringent remission (or at least low disease activity) is maintained, dose reduction should be attempted. Although the prospects for most patients are now favourable, many still do not respond to current therapies. Accordingly, new therapies are urgently required. In this Seminar, we describe current insights into genetics and aetiology, pathophysiology, epidemiology, assessment, therapeutic agents, and treatment strategies together with unmet needs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis...."
rocky mountain spotted fever,"Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing...."
rosacea,"Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis mainly affecting the cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead. Rosacea is characterized by recurrent episodes of flushing or transient erythema, persistent erythema, phymatous changes, papules, pustules, and telangiectasia. The eyes may also be involved. Due to rosacea affecting the face, it has a profound negative impact on quality of life, self-esteem, and well-being. In addition to general skin care, there are several approved treatment options available for addressing these features, both topical and systemic. For some features, intense pulse light, laser, and surgery are of value. Recent advances in fundamental scientific research have underscored the roles of the innate and adaptive immune systems as well as neurovascular dysregulation underlying the spectrum of clinical features of rosacea. Endogenous and exogenous stimuli may initiate and aggravate several pathways in patients with rosacea. This review covers the new phenotype-based diagnosis and classification system reflecting pathophysiology, and new and emerging treatment options and approaches. We address new topical and systemic formulations, as well as recent evidence on treatment combinations. In addition, ongoing studies investigating novel therapeutic interventions will be summarized...."
salivary gland disorder,"A variety of diseases ranging from obstructions, infections, to benign and malignant tumors occur in salivary glands. The most common problem is painful blockage of ducts by stones that prevents drainage of saliva. Sialadenitis can be due to either infectious or noninfectious factors. Bacterial or viral infections are the most common causes of acute sialadenitis. Staphylococcus is the usual bacterial cause, whereas paramyxovirus (mumps) is the common viral cause. Eighty percent of salivary tumors are benign, whereas about 20% are malignant. Most tumors occur in the parotid gland and on the hard palate. Classifications, imaging, and suggested treatment are described...."
scleritis,"Scleritis is a rare painful ocular disorder, associated with severe ocular pain and tissue destruction. Although a majority of these cases are immune mediated and at least half of these are associated with systemic immune-mediated diseases, a smaller minority are due to infections of the sclera. The two conditions closely mimic each other, and a thorough knowledge of the subtle differences is necessary in order to reach a timely diagnosis. Diagnostic delay can lead to a poor outcome both due to the destruction caused by the uncontrolled infection and also due to propagation of the infection with the use of corticosteroids which may have been started for presumed immune mediated scleritis. In this review, we present the clinical features, etiological agents, and the differentiating features between immune and infectious scleritis. We also present diagnostic and management guidelines for managing scleral infection...."
seasonal allergies (hay fever),"Allergic rhinitis (AR) affects more than 400 million people worldwide, making it 1 of the most prevalent chronic diseases. Childhood AR is increasing, and almost half of patients with AR develop symptoms before age 6 years. Although a diagnosis of AR is associated with higher socioeconomic status, underserved and urban populations have more indoor aeroallergen sensitizations and are likely underdiagnosed with AR, further exacerbating health-care disparities. AR negatively impacts quality of life, school performance, and overall health outcomes. Untreated AR in children increases the risk for poor asthma control, increased asthma severity, and exacerbations. Many patients believe that they have seasonal allergies only but in reality have both perennial and seasonal AR, which may change the approach to allergen avoidance measures and treatment recommendations. Pharmacotherapy of AR has expanded, with many intranasal corticosteroids, intranasal antihistamines, and second-generation oral antihistamines approved for pediatric use. Allergen immunotherapy, including both subcutaneous and sublingual forms, are approved for children and are disease modifying, potentially reducing further allergen sensitization and progression to asthma. Many of the currently available biological therapies indicated for pediatric asthma and/or atopic diseases reduce AR symptoms as well. Children with moderate to severe or refractory AR or those with comorbidities should be referred to allergists for diagnostic testing and expanded management options, including immunotherapy and potential biological treatment...."
shingles (herpes zoster),"The Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) or human herpes virus 3 is a neurotropic human alpha herpes virus responsible for chickenpox/varicella and shingles/Herpes zoster (HZ). This review will focus on HZ. Since HZ is secondary to varicella, its incidence increases with age. In children and youngsters, HZ is rare and associated to metabolic and neoplastic disorders. In adults, advanced age, distress, other infections (such as AIDS or COVID-19), and immunosuppression are the most common risk factors. HZ reactivation has recently been observed after COVID-19 vaccination. The disease shows different clinical stages of variable clinical manifestations. Some of the manifestations bear a higher risk of complications. Among the possible complications, postherpetic neuralgia, a chronic pain disease, is one of the most frequent. HZ vasculitis is associated with morbidity and mortality. Renal and gastrointestinal complications have been reported. The cornerstone of treatment is early intervention with acyclovir or brivudine. Second-line treatments are available. Pain management is essential. For (secondary) prophylaxis, currently two HZV vaccines are available for healthy older adults, a live attenuated VZV vaccine and a recombinant adjuvanted VZV glycoprotein E subunit vaccine. The latter allows vaccination also in severely immunosuppressed patients. This review focuses on manifestations of HZ and its management. Although several articles have been published on HZ, the literature continues to evolve, especially in regard to patients with comorbidities and immunocompromised patients. VZV reactivation has also emerged as an important point of discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially after vaccination. The objective of this review is to discuss current updates related to clinical presentations, complications, and management of HZ...."
sialoadenitis,"Salivary gland disorders include inflammatory, bacterial, viral, and neoplastic etiologies. The presentation can be acute, recurrent, or chronic. Acute suppurative sialadenitis presents as rapid-onset pain and swelling and is treated with antibiotics, salivary massage, hydration, and sialagogues such as lemon drops or vitamin C lozenges. Viral etiologies include mumps and human immunodeficiency virus, and treatment is directed at the underlying disease. Recurrent or chronic sialadenitis is more likely to be inflammatory than infectious; examples include recurrent parotitis of childhood and sialolithiasis. Inflammation is commonly caused by an obstruction such as a stone or duct stricture. Management is directed at relieving the obstruction. Benign and malignant tumors can occur in the salivary glands and usually present as a painless solitary neck mass. Diagnosis is made by imaging (e.g., ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) and biopsy (initially with fine-needle aspiration). Overall, most salivary gland tumors are benign and can be treated with surgical excision...."
sickle cell anemia,"Sickle cell disease (SCD), which affects approximately 100,000 individuals in the USA and more than 3 million worldwide, is caused by mutations in the βb globin gene that result in sickle hemoglobin production. Sickle hemoglobin polymerization leads to red blood cell sickling, chronic hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. Acute and chronic pain as well as end-organ damage occur throughout the lifespan of individuals living with SCD resulting in significant disease morbidity and a median life expectancy of 43 years in the USA. In this review, we discuss advances in the diagnosis and management of four major complications: acute and chronic pain, cardiopulmonary disease, central nervous system disease and kidney disease. We also discuss advances in disease-modifying and curative therapeutic options for SCD. The recent availability of L-glutamine, crizanlizumab and voxelotor provides an alternative or supplement to hydroxyurea, which remains the mainstay for disease-modifying therapy. Five-year event-free and overall survival rates remain high for individuals with SCD undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant using matched sibling donors. However, newer approaches to graft-versus-host (GVHD) prophylaxis and the incorporation of post-transplant cyclophosphamide have improved engraftment rates, reduced GVHD and have allowed for alternative donors for individuals without an HLA-matched sibling. Despite progress in the field, additional longitudinal studies, clinical trials as well as dissemination and implementation studies are needed to optimize outcomes in SCD...."
sickle cell crisis,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders affecting about 1 in 500 African American children and 1 in 36,000 Hispanic American children. SCD results in anemia and a ""sickle cell crisis"" (SCC). The main clinical feature of sickle cell disease is the ""acute painful crisis,"" which often requires hospitalization. The term ""sickle cell crisis"" is used to describe several acute conditions such as the vaso-occlusive crisis (acute painful crisis), aplastic crisis, splenic sequestration crisis, hyperhemolytic crisis, hepatic crisis, dactylitis, and acute chest syndrome. Other acute complications include pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis and osteomyelitis, stroke, avascular necrosis, priapism, and venous thromboembolism.  SCC is primarily characterized by severe acute pain and impaired end-organ function. Symptoms of SCC depend on the areas involved. For instance, a vaso-occlusive crisis, which most patients with SCD experience by the age of 6 years, can cause severe pain and swelling of both hands and feet (ie, dactylitis), primarily in young children. Pain can begin from any part of the body but frequently affects the extremities, back, and chest areas. SCD is diagnosed when laboratory evaluation identifies the presence of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). Genetic testing is also used to confirm the diagnosis. In a patient with SCC, evaluation is primarily performed to determine the severity of the acute disease flare. Treatment and management of SCD primarily consists of managing symptoms and associated complications.  About a third of sickle cell disease-related deaths occur within the home setting or 24 hours of hospitalization.[5]] Generally, adults are most likely to die from chronic complications, while children die acutely. The foremost causes of death in sickle cell disease are vaso-occlusive crises, cardiopulmonary threats, infections, and renal issues. Hypoxemia only compounds these problems.   ..."
skin polyp,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is known to affect around 5 % of the total population, with major impact on the quality of life of those severely affected (1). Despite a substantial burden on individuals, society and health economies, CRS often remains underdiagnosed, under-estimated and under-treated (2). International guidelines like the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) (3) and the International Consensus statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Rhinosinusitis 2021 (ICAR) (4) offer physicians insight into the recommended treatment options for CRS, with an overview of effective strategies and guidance of diagnosis and care throughout the disease journey of CRS...."
spinal stenosis,"Narrowing of the spinal canal or foramina is a common finding in spine imaging of the elderly. Only when symptoms of neurogenic claudication and/or cervical myelopathy are present is a spinal stenosis diagnosis made, either of the lumbar spine, cervical spine or both (only very rarely is the thoracic spine involved). Epidemiological data suggest an incidence of 1 case per 100 000 for cervical spine stenosis and 5 cases per 100 000 for lumbar spine stenosis. Cervical myelopathy in patients over 50 years of age is most commonly due to cervical spine stenosis. Symptomatic spinal narrowing can be congenital, or, more frequently, acquired. The latter may be the result of systemic illneses, namely endocrinopathies (such as Cushing disease or acromegaly), calcium metabolism disorders (including hyporarthyroidism and Paget disease), inflammatory diseases (such as rheumathoid arthritis) and infectious diseases. Physical examination is more often abnormal in cervical spondylotic myeloptahy whereas in lumbar spinal stenosis it is typically normal. Therefore spinal stenosis diagnosis relies on the clinical picture corresponding to conspicuous causative changes identified by imaging techniques, most importantly CT and MRI. Other ancillary diagnostic tests are more likely to be yielding for establishing a differential diagnosis, namely vascular claudication. Most patients have a progressive presentation and are offered non operative management as first treatment strategy. Surgery is indicated for progressive intolerable symptoms or, more rarely, for the neurologically catastrophic initial presentations. Surgical strategy consists mainly of decompression (depending on the anatomical level and type of narrowing: laminectomy, foraminotomy, discectomy, corporectomy) with additional instrumentation should spinal stability and sagittal balance be at risk. For cervical spine stenosis the main objective of surgery is to halt disease progression. There is class 1b evidence that surgery is of benefit for lumbar stenosis at least in the short term...."
sprain or strain,"Ankle sprains are highly prevalent with high risk of recurrence. Consequently, there are a significant number of research reports examining strategies for treating and preventing acute and recurrent sprains (otherwise known as chronic ankle instability (CAI)), with a coinciding proliferation of review articles summarising these reports...."
strep throat,"The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0-2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3-4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length...."
stye,"Hordeolum and chalazion are the most frequent inflammatory eyelid tumors. They can occur in association with underlying diseases causing Meibomian gland dysfunction and/or chronic blepharitis. Due to the typical morphological features and clinical course, the diagnosis can mostly be clinically established. The majority of these lesions resolve spontaneously over time. In some instances, surgical intervention is unavoidable. In persistent, recurrent or clinically atypical cases malignant tumors must be excluded as a differential diagnosis by excisional biopsy and histopathological assessment...."
tension headache,"Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent neurological disorder worldwide and is characterized by recurrent headaches of mild to moderate intensity, bilateral location, pressing or tightening quality, and no aggravation by routine physical activity. Diagnosis is based on headache history and the exclusion of alternative diagnoses, with clinical criteria provided by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition. Although the biological underpinnings remain unresolved, it seems likely that peripheral mechanisms are responsible for the genesis of pain in TTH, whereas central sensitization may be involved in transformation from episodic to chronic TTH. Pharmacological therapy is the mainstay of clinical management and can be divided into acute and preventive treatments. Simple analgesics have evidence-based effectiveness and are widely regarded as first-line medications for the acute treatment of TTH. Preventive treatment should be considered in individuals with frequent episodic and chronic TTH, and if simple analgesics are ineffective, poorly tolerated or contraindicated. Recommended preventive treatments include amitriptyline, venlafaxine and mirtazapine, as well as some selected non-pharmacological therapies. Despite the widespread prevalence and associated disability of TTH, little progress has been made since the early 2000s owing to a lack of attention and resource allocation by scientists, funding bodies and the pharmaceutical industry...."
tonsillitis,"Acute tonsillitis is an inflammatory process of the tonsillar tissues and is usually infectious in nature. Acute infections of the palatine tonsils predominantly occur in school-aged children, but patients of any age may be affected. Tonsillitis of viral origin is usually treated with supportive care. Bacterial tonsillitis is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. Polymicrobial infections and viral pathogens are also important sources of infection. Penicillins remain the treatment of choice for S. pyogenes tonsillitis, and augmented aminopenicillins have gained utility in concert with the increasing incidence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria. We describe the anatomic features and the immunologic function of the palatine tonsils, including a detailed discussion of history and physical examination findings, treatment recommendations, and possible complications of acute tonsillitis. Establishing an accurate diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment are key components of managing this common pathologic process...."
tourette syndrome,"Tourette syndrome is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by motor and phonic tics that can substantially diminish the quality of life of affected individuals. Evaluating and treating Tourette syndrome is complex, in part due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and comorbidities between individuals. The underlying pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome is not fully understood, but recent research in the past 5 years has brought new insights into the genetic variations and the alterations in neurophysiology and brain networks contributing to its pathogenesis. Treatment options for Tourette syndrome are expanding with novel pharmacological therapies and increased use of deep brain stimulation for patients with symptoms that are refractory to pharmacological or behavioural treatments. Potential predictors of patient responses to therapies for Tourette syndrome, such as specific networks modulated during deep brain stimulation, can guide clinical decisions. Multicentre data sharing initiatives have enabled several advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome and will be crucial for future large-scale research and in refining effective treatments...."
trichiasis,"Trachoma is the most common infectious cause of blindness. Repeated episodes of infection with Chlamydia trachomatis in childhood lead to severe conjunctival inflammation, scarring, and potentially blinding inturned eyelashes (trichiasis or entropion) in later life. Trachoma occurs in resource-poor areas with inadequate hygiene, where children with unclean faces share infected ocular secretions. Much has been learnt about the epidemiology and pathophysiology of trachoma. Integrated control programmes are implementing the SAFE Strategy: surgery for trichiasis, mass distribution of antibiotics, promotion of facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement. This strategy has successfully eliminated trachoma in several countries and global efforts are underway to eliminate blinding trachoma worldwide by 2020...."
varicose veins,"Varicose veins are twisted, dilated veins most commonly located on the lower extremities. The exact pathophysiology is debated, but it involves a genetic predisposition, incompetent valves, weakened vascular walls, and increased intravenous pressure. Risk factors include family history of venous disease; female sex; older age; chronically increased intra-abdominal pressure due to obesity, pregnancy, chronic constipation, or a tumor; and prolonged standing. Symptoms of varicose veins include a heavy, achy feeling and an itching or burning sensation; these symptoms worsen with prolonged standing. Potential complications include infection, leg ulcers, stasis changes, and thrombosis. Conservative treatment options include external compression; lifestyle modifications, such as avoidance of prolonged standing and straining, exercise, wearing nonrestrictive clothing, modification of cardiovascular risk factors, and interventions to reduce peripheral edema; elevation of the affected leg; weight loss; and medical therapy. There is not enough evidence to determine if compression stockings are effective in the treatment of varicose veins in the absence of active or healed venous ulcers. Interventional treatments include external laser thermal ablation, endovenous thermal ablation, endovenous sclerotherapy, and surgery. Although surgery was once the standard of care, it largely has been replaced by endovenous thermal ablation, which can be performed under local anesthesia and may have better outcomes and fewer complications than other treatments. Existing evidence and clinical guidelines suggest that a trial of compression therapy is not warranted before referral for endovenous thermal ablation, although it may be necessary for insurance coverage...."
vasculitis,"Drug-induced vasculitis is an inflammation of blood vessels caused by the use of various pharmaceutical agents. Vasculitis causes changes in the walls of blood vessels, including thickening, weakening, narrowing and scarring. Inflammation can be short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) and can be so severe that the tissues and organs supplied by the affected vessels do not get enough blood. The shortage of blood can result in organ and tissue damage, even death. Drug-induced vasculitis is the most common form of vasculitis. The differential diagnosis between drug-induced and idiopathic vasculitic conditions may be difficult in the individual patient. Withdrawal may be helpful to distinguish between these syndromes. Withdrawal of the offending agent alone is often sufficient to induce prompt resolution of clinical manifestations, obviating the need for immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs. Increasing understanding of the pathophysiological characteristics of all inflammatory vasculitides should lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to drug-induced vasculitis...."
venous insufficiency,"Chronic venous insufficiency is an extensive progressive disease in need of public health attention. This insidious disease is a growing burden on patient quality of life and the health economy. Chronic venous insufficiency has become more pronounced in global populations, especially in regions exhibiting a higher rate of risk factors. It is critical for healthcare providers to recognise and intervene early to prevent ongoing and debilitating complications. This article provides a comprehensive review of chronic venous insufficiency outlining the anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, assessment and management options...."
vesicoureteral reflux,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the commonest congenital anomaly of urinary tract in children. It is mostly diagnosed after a urinary tract infection or during evaluation for congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract. High-grade VUR, recurrent pyelonephritis, and delayed initiation of antibiotic treatment are important risk factors for renal scarring. The management of VUR depends on multiple factors and may include surveillance only or antimicrobial prophylaxis; very few patients with VUR need surgical correction. Patients with renal scarring should be monitored for hypertension and those with significant scarring should also be monitored for proteinuria and chronic kidney disease...."
vulvar disorder,"Vulvar dermatoses are inflammatory conditions responsible for chronic or recurrent itching and soreness. The lesions are either circumscribed to the vulva or associated with extragenital localizations which may help to assess the diagnosis. They should be differentiated from infectious or neoplastic diseases which may have clinical similarities. As opposed to the majority of all dermatoses that have a benign and regular course, lichen sclerosus or lichen planus could exceptionally foster the occurrence of an epithelial cancer precursor which may evolve to squamous cell carcinoma. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment of vulvar dermatosis. We do not know if the treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus and vulvar lichen planus prevents squamous cell carcinoma...."
vulvodynia,"Vulvodynia is a condition that occurs in 8-10% of women of all ages and is characterized by pain at the vulva that is present during sexual and/or non-sexual situations. Diagnosis is established through careful medical history and pelvic examination, including the cotton-swab test. The onset and maintenance of vulvodynia involves a complex interplay of peripheral and central pain mechanisms, pelvic floor muscle and autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, depression and childhood maltreatment as well as cognitive-affective, behavioural and interpersonal factors. Given the absence of empirically supported treatment guidelines, a stepwise approach of pelvic floor physical therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy as well as medical management is suggested, with surgery as the last option. Vulvodynia has a negative effect on the quality of life of women and their partners, and imposes a profound personal and societal economic burden. In addition, women with vulvodynia are more likely to report other chronic pain conditions, which further alters their quality of life. Future efforts should aim to increase girls', women's and healthcare professionals' education and awareness of vulvodynia, phenotype different subgroups of women based on biopsychosocial characteristics among more diverse samples, conduct longitudinal studies and improve clinical trial designs...."
